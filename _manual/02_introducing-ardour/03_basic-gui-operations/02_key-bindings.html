<p>
  Almost every available function in Ardour can be executed via a
  <dfn>key binding</dfn> or <dfn><abbr title="Open Sound
  Control">OSC</abbr></dfn> command. There are many more functions
  available than there are keys on even the largest current computer
  keyboards, so only a subset of them are bound to keys by default.
</p>
<h2>Key bindings for menu items</h2>
<p>
  Existing key bindings in menus are listed on the right side of the
  menu items.
</p>
<p>
  To create a custom key binding for a menu item quickly, navigate to
  the relevant (sub-) menu, hover over the item with the mouse and press
  the desired combination of modifiers and key.
</p>  
<p class="warning">
  Ardour will silently re-assign the binding if you use a key
  combination that is already in use, possibly removing a standard
  keyboard shortcut without warning you. That might lead to confusion
  when you ask other users for help, and they explain something in terms
  of a standard key binding, which will then have a completely
  different effect on your system.
</p>
<h2>Key binding editor</h2>
<p>
  For a complete overview of all existing keyboard bindings, go to 
  <kbd class="menu">Window &gt; Key Bindings</kbd>. This widget will let
  you view and edit even those functions that are not available in the menu,
  and even remove key bindings altogether.
