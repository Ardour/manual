title: Deleting Objects
---                        

<p>
  Within the Editor window (and to some extent within the Mixer window too),
  there are several techniques for <dfn>deleting</dfn> objects (regions, 
  control points, and more).
</p>

<h2>Using the mouse and keyboard</h2>
<p>
  Select the object(s) and then press the <kbd>Del</kbd> key. 
  This does <strong>not</strong> put the deleted object(s) into the cut
  buffer, so they cannot be pasted elsewhere.
</p>

<h2>Using normal cut and paste shortcuts</h2>
<p>
  Select the object(s) and then press <kbd class="mod1">x</kbd>. This puts
  the deleted object(s) into the cut buffer so that they could be pasted
  elsewhere.
</p>

<h2>Using just the mouse</h2>
<p>
  By default, <kbd class="mouse">Shift Right</kbd> will delete the
  clicked-upon object. Like the Del key, this does <strong>not</strong> 
  put the deleted object(s) into the cut buffer.
</p>
<p>
  The modifier and mouse button used for this can be controlled via 
  <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; User Interaction &gt; 
  Delete using ...</kbd>. Any modifier and mouse button combination can 
  be used.
</p>
