<p>Ardour is designed to work best with a 3 button mouse equipped with a scroll wheel. </p>
<p>It can be used with a 2 button mouse or touchpad, but at least 2 key operations will not (easily) be available to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>time-constrained region copying
</li>
<li><a href="/using-control-surfaces/midi-learn/">MIDI bindings</a> created by "learning" them from incoming MIDI
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to invest in a 3 button mouse. You will find that a good quality mouse (especially one with a weighted, latchable scroll wheel) will make your use of Ardour vastly more efficient. They are cheap, and time is not.</p>
