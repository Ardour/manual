title: Starting Ardour
---

<p>
  There are several ways of <dfn>starting Ardour</dfn>, which may vary
  depending on which platform you are using it.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>double-click the Ardour icon in your platform's file manager (e.g.
  Nautilus on Linux, Finder on OS X)</li>
  <li>double click on an Ardour session file in your platform's file manager</li>
  <li>on Linux, you can also start Ardour on the command line (see below)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  When Ardour is run for the very first time, a special dialog is displayed
  that will ask you several questions about your setup. You will not be asked
  these questions again, but you can always modify your choices via the
  <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences</kbd> dialog.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to use JACK, in general, it is sensible to start it <em>before</em> you run Ardour. This is not
  necessary, but will provide you with more control and options over JACK's operation.
  You can start JACK through its <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr>, or using a <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>
  program, like <a href="https://qjackctl.sourceforge.io/">QjackCtl</a> or <a href="http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Applications:Cadence">Cadence</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you open Ardour without specifying an existing session it will display
  the <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; New...</kbd> dialog and the <kbd class="menu">Audio/MIDI Setup</kbd> dialog.
  See <a href="/working-with-sessions/new-session-dialog/">New/Open Session Dialog</a> for a description of those dialogs.
</p>

<h2>Starting Ardour From the Command Line (Linux)</h2>

<p>
  Like (almost) any other program on Linux, Ardour can be started on the
  command line. Type the following command in a terminal window:
</p>
<kbd class="cmd lin">Ardour5</kbd>
<p>
  To start Ardour with an existing session:
</p>
<kbd class="cmd lin">Ardour5 <em>/path/to/session</em></kbd>
<p>
  replacing /path/to/session with the actual path to your session. You can
  specify either the session folder or any session file inside the folder,
  including snapshots.
</p>
<p>
  To start Ardour with a new, named session:
</p>
<kbd class="cmd lin">Ardour5 -N <em>/path/to/session</em></kbd>
