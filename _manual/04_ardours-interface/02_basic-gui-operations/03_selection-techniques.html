title: Selection Techniques
---                        


  
  <p>Ardour follows the conventions used by most other computer software (including other DAWs) for selecting objects in the GUI.</p>
<h2>Selecting individual objects</h2>
<p>Clicking on object (sometimes in a particular part of its on-screen representation) will select the object, and deselect other similar objects.</p>
<h2>Selecting multiple (similar) objects</h2>
<p><kbd class="mod1">click</kbd> on an object toggles it selected status, so using <kbd class="mod1">click</kbd> on a series of objects will select (or deselect) each one of them. You can construct completely arbitrary selections with this technique.</p>
<h2>Selecting a range of objects</h2>
<p>In cases where the idea of "select all objects between this one and that one" makes sense, you can click one object and then Shift click another to select both of them as well as all object in between them. </p>
<h2>Range Selection</h2>
<p>These basic principles apply to <a href="/missing">Range Selection</a> - click-drag to select a range, <kbd class="mod1">drag</kbd> to create multiple ranges and shift-click to extend a range to cover a wider area.</p>
