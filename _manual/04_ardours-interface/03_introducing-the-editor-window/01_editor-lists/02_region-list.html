title: Region List
---                        

<p>The region list shows all the regions in the session. The left-hand column gives the region name, and there are a range of times given for information. At the right of the list are four columns of flags that can be altered:</p>
<dl>
<dt>L</dt>
<dd>whether the region position is locked, so that it cannot be moved.</dd>
<dt>G</dt>
<dd>whether the region's position is &lsquo;glued&rsquo; to bars and beats. If so, the region will stay at the same position in bars and beats even if the tempo and/or time signature change.</dd>
<dt>M</dt>
<dd>whether the region is muted, so that it will not be heard.</dd>
<dt>O</dt>
<dd>whether the region is opaque; opaque regions &lsquo;block&rsquo; regions below them from being heard, whereas &lsquo;transparent&rsquo; regions have their contents mixed with whatever is underneath. </dd>
</dl>
<p>Hovering the mouse pointer over a column heading shows a tool-tip which can be handy to remember what the columns are for.</p>
<p>A handy feature of the region list is that its regions can be dragged and dropped into a suitable track in the session.</p>
