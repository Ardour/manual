<h2>Mouse Modes</h2>
<dl class="wide-table">
  <dt id="object">Object Mode</dt>
  <dd>The <dfn>object mode</dfn> is used for selecting, moving, deleting and 
  copying objects. When in object mode, the mouse pointer appears as a hand
  whenever it is over the track canvas or the rulers. The mouse can now be
  used to select and perform operations on objects such as regions, markers etc.
  This is the most common mode to work in, as it allows you to select and move regions,
  as well as modify automation points on the automation tracks.
  </dd>
  <dt>Range Mode</dt>
  <dd>When in <dfn>range mode</dfn>, the mouse pointer appears as a vertical line
  whenever it is over the track canvas or the rulers. The mouse will now be
  able to select a point or range of time. Time ranges can be selected over
  one or several tracks, depending on the selection of your tracks.
  <p>
  If none of your tracks are selected, the Range Tool will operate on all the
  session track visualized in the Editor.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you want to edit only particular tracks, select them before you apply
  the range tool.
  </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Zoom Tool</dt>
  <dd>When in <dfn>zoom mode</dfn>, the mouse pointer appears as a magnifying glass
  whenever it is over the track canvas or the rulers. Select the area to
  zoom to with a <kbd class="mouse">Left drag</kbd>. A single <kbd
  class="mouse">Left</kbd> click zooms in by one level around the mouse cursor, 
  likewise a single <kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd> click will zoom out by one
  level.</dd>
  <dt>Region Gain Tool</dt>
  <dd>When in <dfn>gain edit</dfn> mode, the mouse pointer will change to
  cross-hairs. You can then click within a region to change the <dfn>gain
  envelope</dfn> for that region. This curve is separate from fader automation
  for individual tracks. It will remain locked to the region's time, so if the
  region is moved, the region gain envelope is moved along with it.</dd>
  <dt>Time Effects Tool</dt>
  <dd>When in <dfn>time fx</dfn> mode, the mouse pointer appears as a
  distinctive expanding square symbol whenever it is over the track canvas or
  the rulers. This mode is used to resize regions using a timestretch
  algorithm.
  Click on an edge of a region of audio and drag it one way or the other to
  stretch or shrink the region.</dd>
  <dt>Audition Tool</dt>
  <dd>Clicking a region using the <dfn>audition tool</dfn> will play this
  region to the control room outputs.
  <p>You can also <dfn>scrub</dfn> with this tool by clicking and dragging in
  the direction you wish to listen.  The amount you drag in one direction or
  the other will determine the playback speed.</p>

<p>
  The <dfn>Smart Mode</dfn> button to the left of the mouse mode buttons
  modifies <dfn>Object mode</dfn>. When enabled, the mouse behaves as if it
  is in "Range Tool" mode in the upper half of a region, and in "Object Tool"
  mode in the lower half.
