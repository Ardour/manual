<h3>Mouse Modes</h3>
<dl class="wide-table">
<dt>Object Tool</dt>
<dd>Used for selecting, moving, deleting and copying objects. See below for a full description.</dd>
<dt>Range Mode</dt>
<dd>When in range mode, the mouse pointer appears as a vertical line whenever it is over the track canvas or the rulers. The mouse will now be able to select a point or range of time. Time ranges can be selected over one or several tracks, depending ond the selection of your tracks.
<p>If none of your track is selected, the Range Tool will operate on all the session track visualized in the Editor.</p>
<p>If you want to operate just some track, select the track you want to edit with the Range Tool.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Zoom Tool</dt>
<dd>When in zoom mode, the mouse pointer appears as a magnifying glass whenever it is over the track canvas or the rulers. This mode is used to zoom the display to any range that is determined by clicking and dragging the Button1 to specify the range.  You can also utilize a single click with Button1 to zoom in by one level focused on the mouse cursor, likewise a single click on Button3 will zoom out by one level focused on the mouse.</dd>
<dt>Region Gain Tool</dt>
<dd>When in gain edit mode, the mouse pointer will change to cross-hairs. You can then click within a region to change the gain automation for that region. This automation is separate from fader automation for individual tracks, but works in conjunction with the track's fader. This automation will remain locked to the region's time, so if the region is moved, the region gain automation is moved along with it.</dd>
<dt>TimeFX Tool</dt>
<dd>When in timefx mode, the mouse pointer appears as a distinctive 'expanding' illustration whenever it is over the track canvas or the rulers. This mode is used to resize regions using a timestretch algorithm.  It is utilized by clicking on an edge of a region of audio and dragging it one way or the other to either stretch or shrink the region.</dd>
<dt>Audition Tool</dt>
<dd>Clicking a region using the "audition" tool will audition the region.
<p>You can also "scrub" with this tool by clicking and dragging in the direction you wish to listen.  The amount you drag in one direction or the other will determine the playback speed.</p>
