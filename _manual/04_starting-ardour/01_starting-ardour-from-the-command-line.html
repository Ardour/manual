<p>
  Like (almost) any other program on Linux, Ardour can be started on the
  command line. Type the following command in a terminal window:
</p>
<kbd class="cmd lin">Ardour5</kbd>
<p>
  To start Ardour with an existing session:
</p>
<kbd class="cmd lin">Ardour5 <em>/path/to/session</em></kbd>
<p>
  replacing /path/to/session with the actual path to your session. You can
  specify either the session folder or any session file inside the folder,
  including snapshots.
</p>
<p>
  To start Ardour with a new, named session:
</p>
<kbd class="cmd lin">Ardour5 -N <em>/path/to/session</em></kbd>
