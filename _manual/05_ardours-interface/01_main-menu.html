title: Main Menu

<p>
  The <dfn>Main Menu</dfn> is made of 8 menus that allow the user to interact with Ardour, and below is a reference of all the menu actions.
</p>

<p>
  Notice that a lot of this menus, and probably all of the most used ones have keyboard shortcuts to ease and fasten the work.
  A sum-up of these shortcuts can be found on the <a href="/default-keyboard-bindings/">Defaults Keyboard Bindings</a> page, and
  every menu in Ardour can be reassigned to an user defined key binding, or used via <a href="/using-control-surfaces/controlling-ardour-with-osc/">OSC</a> with
  a control surface.
