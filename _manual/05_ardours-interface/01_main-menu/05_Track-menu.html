	<dt>Duplicate Tracks/Busses...</dt><dd>Shows the <kbd class="menu">Duplicate Tracks and Busses</kbd> window, allowing to duplicate the selected track(s) and optionnaly, its playlist</dd>

	<dt>Toggle Solo</dt><dd>Sets the solo On on the selected tracks, so only these tracks will play</dd>
	<dt>Toggle Mute</dt><dd>Mutes the selected tracks, they wont play until unmuted</dd>

	<dt>Insert Time</dt><dd>Shows the <kbd class="menu">Insert Time</kbd> window, allowing to insert a blank time in the selected tracks' playlist. By default, it'll be inserted at the Edit Point, but that can be changed in the dialog, as does the behaviour of the regions</dd>
	<dt>Remove Time</dt><dd>Same as above, but to remove time</dd>
	<dt>Move Selected Tracks Up</dt><dd>Changes the position of the selected tracks one track up towards the top. In the mixer, the tracks will be moved to the left.</dd>

	<dt>Height</dt>

		<dt class="sub1">Largest</dt><dd>Sets the selected tracks height to a very high value, hence making the tracks wide on screen</dd>
		<dt class="sub1">Larger</dt><dd>Same as above, but a little less high</dd>
		<dt class="sub1">Large</dt><dd>Same as above, but again less high</dd>
		<dt class="sub1">Normal</dt><dd>Sets the height of the track to its default value which is a trade-off between readability and number of tracks displayed</dd>
		<dt class="sub1">Small</dt><dd>Reduces the size of the tracks to a low value, increasing the number of on screen tracks</dd>

	<dt>Toggle Active</dt><dd>Toggles the active state of a track. An inactive track will be grayed and wont play any sound. That can be seen in the <kbd class="menu">A</kbd> colomn of the <a href="/ardours-interface/editor-lists/tracks-and-busses-list/">Tracks and Busses List</a></dd>
	<dt>Remove</dt><dd>Deletes this track and its playlist (no file is harmed in the process, and the regions from the playlist stay in the Editor for later use)</dd>
