<p>The status bar is an informative bar at the top of the window, showing:</p>

<ul>

  <li><dfn>File:</dfn> the file format used in the session, including when recording</li>

  <li><dfn>TC:</dfn> is the timecode, i.e. the number of frames per second used by the session (for videos)</li>

  <li><dfn>Audio:</dfn> gives the sample rate used in the session, and the latency computed from the buffer size</li>

  <li><dfn>Buffers:</dfn> decribe how much data is buffered, see below</li>

  <li><dfn>DSP:</dfn> for Digital Sound Processing, shows how much of the CPU is used by Ardour and its plugins</li>

  <li><dfn>X:</dfn> shows the number of xruns since Ardour's launch, see below</li>

  <li><dfn>Disk:</dfn> reports the remaining hard disk space as the time that can be recorded with the current session setting</li>

  <li><dfn>a Clock</dfn> showing the system time</li>

  <li><dfn>a Log button</dfn> that indicates if Ardour has encountered any warning or error.</li>

</ul>



<p>The buffers are labelled as <kbd class="menu">p</kbd> for playback and <kbd class="menu">c</kbd> for capture. If the

system is fast enough, these buffers should be 100% full at all times, showing the system has time to precompute

all the data before delivering it to the audio system. A buffer constantly under 20% is a sign of an underpowered

computer system or of too much processing.</p>



<p>An Xrun (short for buffer over- or under-run) happens when the system has been forced to skip audio frames, e.g. if the latency

asked is too short for the computing power of the machine. It usually results in clicks, pops and crackles if it happens while recording.</p>



<p>The log button turns yellow when a warning is shows, and red when an error occurs. Clicking the log button gives acces to the log.</p>
