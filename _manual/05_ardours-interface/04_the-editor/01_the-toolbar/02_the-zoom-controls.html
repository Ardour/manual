<p>The zoom controls allow to navigate the session along both the time and track axes.</p>



<p>The drop down <kbd class="menu">Zoom Focus</kbd> menu allows to select a focus

point for the zoom, i.e. the center of the zoom. The choices are :</p>



<ul>

  <li><dfn>Left</dfn> of the screen</li>

  <li><dfn>Right</dfn> of the screen</li>

  <li><dfn>Center</dfn> of the screen</li>

  <li><dfn>Playhead</dfn></li>

  <li><dfn>Mouse</dfn></li>

  <li><dfn>Edit Point</dfn> as set in the <a href="/ardours-interface/the-editor/the-toolbar/the-edit-point-control/">Edit point</a> control.</li>

</ul>



<p>The 2 leftmost zoom buttons (<kbd class="menu">&minus;</kbd> and

<kbd class="menu">&plus;</kbd>) use this zoom focus to zoom out and in

respectively.<p>



<p>The <kbd class="menu">Zoom to session</kbd> button is a handy shortcut to zoom

out or in until all the session (as defined by it's <a href="/working-with-markers/">start/end

markers</a>) fits horizontally.</p>



<p>Changing the <kbd class="menu">Number of visible tracks</kbd> dropdown menu

allows to fit this number of tracks vertically in the screen.<p>



<p class="note">There <em>is</em> a minimal track height to keep it visible, so

according to you screen vertical size, some high number can have no effect.</p>



<p>Inside this menu are 2 handy choices :</p>

<ul>

  <li><dfn>Selected tracks</dfn> that focus on the selected tracks. If the selected

  tracks are not contiguous, the unselected tracks inbetween will be hidden, see

  the <a href="/ardours-interface/the-editor/the-editor_s-lists/tracks-and-busses-list/">Track and Bus list</a>.</li>

  <li><dfn>All</dfn> that fits all the tracks of the sessions vertically (provided

  there's enough screen estate).</li>

</ul>



<p>The rightmost buttons <kbd class="menu">Shrink tracks</kbd> and

<kbd class="menu">Expand tracks</kbd> reduce or expand the vertical size of the

selected tracks. If no track is selected, all the tracks will be shrunk or

expanded each time the button is pushed.
