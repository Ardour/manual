title: Region List
---



<p>

  The region list shows all the regions in the session. The left-hand column gives the region name, and there are a range of times given for information:

</p>



<dl>

  <dt>Position</dt><dd>position of the start of the region on the global timeline</dd>

  <dt>End</dt><dd>position of the region on the global timeline</dd>

  <dt>Length</dt><dd>duration of the region</dd>

  <dt>Sync</dt><dd>position of the sync point, relative to the start of region (can be negative)</dd>

  <dt>Fade In</dt><dd>duration of the fade in. Can't be less than 1 ms, to avoid clipping.</dd>

  <dt>Fade Out</dt><dd>duration of the fade out (positive value, &ge; 1 ms).</dd>

</dl>



<p>

  The units used to display those times are those used for the clock, so changing the units on the clocks change the display of this values.

</p>



<p>

  At the right of the list are four columns of flags that can be altered:

</p>



<dl>

  <dt>L</dt>

  <dd>whether the region position is locked, so that it cannot be moved.</dd>

  <dt>G</dt>

  <dd>whether the region's position is &lsquo;glued&rsquo; to bars and beats. If so, the region will stay at the same position in bars and beats even if the tempo and/or time signature change.</dd>

  <dt>M</dt>

  <dd>whether the region is muted, so that it will not be heard.</dd>

  <dt>O</dt>

  <dd>whether the region is opaque; opaque regions &lsquo;block&rsquo; regions below them from being heard, whereas &lsquo;transparent&rsquo; regions have their contents mixed with whatever is underneath. </dd>

</dl>



<p>

  Hovering the mouse pointer over a column heading shows a tool-tip which can be handy to remember what the columns are for.

<p>

  A handy feature of the region list is that its regions can be dragged and dropped into a suitable track in the session.
