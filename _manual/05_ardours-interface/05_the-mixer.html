<p>
  The <dfn>Mixer</dfn> window represents signal flow and
  is the window you will probably be using most when mixing a session. It
  includes <dfn>channel strips</dfn> for each track and bus in your session.
  It has a general "vertical" sense to it: signals flow from the top of each
  channel strip through the processing elements in the strip to reach the
  output listed at the bottom.
