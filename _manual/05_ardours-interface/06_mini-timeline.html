<p>
  The mini-timeline allows, as the <a href="/ardours-interface/the-summary/">Summary</a>,
  to navigate a session. It's main advantage though is that it stays visible even in Mixer mode.
</p>

<p>
  The range of time covered by the mini-timeline is set by <kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd> clicking the
  timeline, and chossing from 30 seconds up to 20 minutes.
</p>

<p>
  The mini-timeline also shows all the markers (both start/end and user set ones).
  Clicking a marker jumps to that point on the timeline, allowing for quick access
  to key timings in the session.
</p>
<p>
  While hovering with the mouse over the mini-timeline,
</p>
<ul>
  <li><kbd class="mouse">left</kbd> clicking jumps the playhead to the time under the mouse cursor</li>
  <li>using the <kbd class="mouse">scroll wheel</kbd> scrolls the playhead inside the session</li>
  <li>using the <kbd class="mod1">&nbsp;</kbd><kbd class="mouse">scroll wheel</kbd> scrolls more finely inside the session</li>
  <li>using the <kbd class="mod1">&nbsp;</kbd><kbd class="mod2">&nbsp;</kbd><kbd class="mouse">scroll wheel</kbd> scrolls even more finely inside the session.</li>
</ul>
