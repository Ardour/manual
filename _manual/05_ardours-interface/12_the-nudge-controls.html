<p>

  The <dfn>nudge controls</dfn> will move the selected region(s) by a fixed amount

  of time. The left and right buttons move either backward or forward in time, and the small

  clock to the left of these buttons sets the amount of time to nudge by.

  As with all other clocks, you can right-click on the clock to choose the

  time representation you want to use.

<p>

  If there are no selected objects, the nudge controls can be

  used to move the playhead backward or forward by the amount shown on the clock.
