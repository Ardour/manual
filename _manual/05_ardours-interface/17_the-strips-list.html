title: Strips List
---

<p>
  The <dfn>Strips List</dfn> is a quick way to manage big sessions, with lots of tracks,
  where the mixer would otherwise be too crowded.
</p>

<p>
  It is a list of all the tracks, busses and VCA in the session, with a tick to allow
  for hiding or showing them. This visibility status also affects the Editor view, and is exactly the same as
  toggling the <kbd class="option">V</kbd> checkbox in the
  <a href="/ardours-interface/editor-lists/tracks-and-busses-list/">Tracks and Busses</a>
  panel of the Editor List.
</p>

<p>
  Dragging and dropping tracks inside the Strips List allows to reorganise the tracks in the session,
  both in the Mixer and the Editor. Clicking a track scrolls the Mixer to show this track.
</p>

<p>
  It is possible, by <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd> clicking, to act on multiple tracks at once:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Show All</li>
  <li>Hide All</li>
  <li>Show All Audio Tracks</li>
  <li>Hide All Audio Tracks</li>
  <li>Show All Audio Busses</li>
  <li>Hide All Audio Busses</li>
  <li>Show All MIDI Tracks</li>
  <li>Hide All MIDI Tracks</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The <kbd class="menu">&plus;</kbd> button under the list is a shortcut to create a new track,
  bus or VCA, as in clicking <kbd class="menu">Track &gt; Add Track, Bus or VCA...</kbd>.
</p>
