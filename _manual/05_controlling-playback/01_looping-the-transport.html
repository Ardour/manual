<p>When the <code>loop</code> transport button is pressed, the playhead will jump the start of the loop range, and continue to the end of the loop range before returning to the start and repeating.</p>
<p>While looping, a light green area is displayed over the tracks to show the loop range.</p>
<p>For more information on defining and altering the loop range see <a href="/working-with-markers/the-loop-range">Loop Range Markers</a>.</p>
