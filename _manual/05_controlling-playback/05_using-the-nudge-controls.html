title: Using the Nudge Controls
---                        
  
<p>
  If there are no selected objects, the <dfn>nudge controls</dfn> can be 
  used to move the playhead backward or forward by a fixed amount. The left 
  and right buttons move either backward or forward in time, and the small 
  clock to the left of these buttons sets the amount of time to nudge by. 
  As with all other clocks, you can right-click on the clock to choose the 
  time representation you want to use.

<p>
  Note that this is a secondary purpose of the nudge controls &mdash; it is
  usually used to move selected <dfn>objects</dfn> by specific distances, rather than
  the playhead.
