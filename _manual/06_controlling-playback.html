<h2>Positioning the Playhead</h2>

<p>
  The <dfn>playhead</dfn> is a vertical line with two arrows at each end
  that indicates the current position of playback.
</p>

<h3>Positioning the playhead at the current pointer position</h3>
<p>
  Pressing <kbd>P</kbd> will set the playhead to the current position of
  the pointer, if it is within the editor track area.
</p>

<h3>Positioning the playhead on the timeline</h3>
<p>
  A <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd> click anywhere on the timeline (rulers)
  will move the playhead to that position.
</p>

<h3>Positioning the playhead with the transport clocks</h3>
<p>
  Click on either the primary or secondary transport clock and
  <a href="/ardours-interface/transport-bar-and-times/times/">edit their value</a> 
  to move the playhead to a specific position.
</p>

<h3>Positioning the playhead at a marker</h3>
<p>
  Click <kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd> on the marker and select either
  <kbd class="menu">Locate to here</kbd> or <kbd class="menu">Play from
  here</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, place the pointer on the marker and press
  <kbd>P</kbd> to set the playhead.
</p>


<h2>Looping the Transport</h2>

<p>
  When the <dfn>loop transport</dfn> button is pressed, the playhead will
  jump the start of the loop range, and continue to the end of that range
  before returning to the start and repeating.
  While looping, a light green area is displayed in the time ruler over
  the tracks to show the loop range.
</p>
<p>
  By default, looping is bound to the <kbd>l</kbd> key.
</p>
<p>
  For more information on defining and altering the loop range see
  <a href="/working-with-markers/loop-range/">Loop Range Markers</a>.
