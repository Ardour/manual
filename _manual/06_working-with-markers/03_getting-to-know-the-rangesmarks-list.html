title: Getting To Know the Ranges &amp; Marks List
---                        


  
  
<p>The <code>Ranges &amp; Marks</code> List is visible on a tab in the <code>Editor Lists</code> area. If the editor list area isn't visible it can be enabled by checking the box in the main pull down menus <code>View &gt; Show Editor List</code>. The <code>Ranges &amp; Marks</code> list can be used as a single point of control for all range and location markers (including the punch and loop ranges), or as a supplement to other methods of working with them.</p>
<p>The first section <code>Loop&#47;Punch Ranges</code> shows the current loop and punch range settings; there are three clocks, the first is the start of the range, the second is the end of the range and the last is the length of the range. The start and end points have a ‘Use PH’ button beside them, which can be clicked to set the corresponding position clock to the current position of the playhead in the editor timeline. Last in the row are 3 checkboxes. The first checkbox is <code>Hide</code> This hides the marker in the editor. Even though it is now hidden it is possible to still locate to the marker. The next checkbox is <code>Lock</code>, this will lock the marker in the editor so it can't be moved until it is unlocked. The last checkbox is <code>Glue</code>, this fixes the marker position relative to the current tempo and respects changes in tempo.</p>
<p>The Next section is <code>Markers &#40;Including CD Index&#41;</code> which is a list of the session's markers. For each marker there is a name dialog, that can be edited by clicking on it, a clock that represents the location of the marker, a <code>Use PH</code> button that moves the marker to the current playhead location, and four checkboxes. The first checkbox is <code>CD</code>, this will set the marker for Redbook TOC exporting. The <code>Hide</code>, <code>Lock</code>, and <code>Glue</code> buttons all function the same as in the above section.</p>
<p>The Next section is the <code>Ranges &#40;Including CD Track Ranges&#41;</code>. Just like the <code>Loop&#47;Punch Ranges</code> section there are three clocks that serve the same purpose. The checkboxes are the same arrangement and function as the <code>Markers &#40;Including CD Index&#41;</code> however without the <code>Glue</code> checkbox</p>
<p>At the bottom of the list are buttons to add new markers or ranges.</p>
<p>The <code>-</code> button beside each item in the list allows that particular marker to be removed. A middle click over any of the clocks will locate the playhead at that location in the editor. Right clicking on any of the clocks brings up a context menu that allows changing of the display between, <code>Timecode</code>, <code>Bars:Beats</code>and, <code>Minutes:Seconds and samples</code>. In addition to the clock displays there is an option in the context menu to select <code>Set From Playhead</code>, that sets the markers location to the current location of the playhead in the editor window, and <code>Locate to This Time</code>, that moves the playhead to the location of the position listed in the clock.</p>
