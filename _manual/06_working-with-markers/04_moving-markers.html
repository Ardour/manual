  <h2>Single marker</h2>
<p>Click and drag to move a single marker to a new location on the timeline. </p>
<h2>Multiple markers</h2>
<p>It is possible to move multiple markers by the same distance. Ctrl-click each marker you want to move, then drag one of the selected markers to a new location. All other selected markers will move together. Note that the markers are bounded by the zero point on the timeline. In otherwords the first marker in your selection cannot move to the left of zero on the timeline.</p>
<h2>Both ends of a range marker</h2>
<p>Ctrl-drag one end of the range marker (either the start or the end). The other end of range marker will move by the same distance.</p>
