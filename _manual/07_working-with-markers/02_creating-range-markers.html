<p>
  <dfn>Range markers</dfn> are essentially two location markers the are grouped
  together to mark the beginning and end of a section in the timeline. 
</p> 
<h2>Creating a Range on the timeline</h2>
<p>
  To create a new <dfn>range</dfn>, right-click on the  
  Ranges ruler at the top of the timeline, then select
  <kbd class="menu">New Range</kbd>. 
  Two markers with the same name will appear along the ruler. 
  Both marks can be moved along the timeline by clicking and dragging 
  them to the desired location.
</p>
<p>
  It is also possible to create range markers from a selected range or
  region in the Editor window, or to use the <kbd class="menu">Ranges 
  &amp; Marks List</kbd> in the Editor list.
