title: Backup and Sharing of Sessions
---                        


  
  
<p>An Ardour session is stored in a single folder on your computer's filesystem. This makes backup very easy - any tool capable of backing up a folder (i.e. all of them) can be used to backup a session. You pick the location of a session when it is created - by default it will be in your default session location, which can be altered via <code>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Misc &gt; Session Management</code>. </p>
<blockquote><p>
There is complication: a session may reference embedded media that are stored outside of the session folder. At this time (December 2012), there is no particularly good solution for this. Backing up a session with embedded files will not create a copy of the session containing those files.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The single folder approach also makes sharing a project easy. Simply copy the session folder (onto a storage device, or across a network) and another Ardour user (on any platform) will be able to use it. The limitation regarding embedded files applies to session sharing as well.</p>
