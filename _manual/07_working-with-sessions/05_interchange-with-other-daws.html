title: Interchange with other DAWs
---                        


  
  
<p>It has never been particularly easy to move sessions/projects created on one DAW to another. There are two "standards" that exist that have reasonably widespread support:</p>
<ul>
<li>OMF (Open Media Framwwork), also known as OMFI. Developed and controlled by Avid, never standardized</li>
<li>AAF (Advanced Authoring Format). Developed by a consortium of media-related corporations.</li>
</ul>
<p>but in practice both of these "standards" have such complex and/or incomplete specifications that different DAWs support them partially, differently or not at all. </p>
