title: Copying The Interchange Folder

<p>All media in a session folder is stored in a sub-folder called "interchange". Below that is another folder with the name of the session. You can copy either of these to another location and use the files within them with any other application, importing them all into a project/session. You will lose all information about regions, tracks, and timeline positioning, but all the data that Ardour was working with will be present in the other DAW. Nothing below the "interchange" folder is specific to Ardour - any DAW or other audio/MIDI application should be able to handle the files without any issues.</p>
