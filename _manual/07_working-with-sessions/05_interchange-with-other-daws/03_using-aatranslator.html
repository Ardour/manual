title: Using AATranslator
---                        
  
<p>
  <dfn>AATranslator</dfn> is a Windows 
  application that can convert sessions/projects from many diffferent DAWs 
  into other formats. At the present time (December 2012), it can read and 
  write Ardour 2.X sessions, and can read Ardour 3 sessions. 
</p>
<p>
  The program runs very well on Linux using 
  <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> (a Windows environment for Linux). 
  There are equivalent solutions for running Windows applications on OS X, 
  but we have no experience with them at this time. Ardour users have reported 
  great results using AATranslator on Ardour 2.X sessions.</p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.aatranslator.com.au/">AATranslator website</a> 
  has full details on supported formats and DAWs. The list includes
  ProTools, Live, Reaper, OMF, AAF and many more.
