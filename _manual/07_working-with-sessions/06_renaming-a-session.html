title: Renaming a Session
---                        


  
  
<p>Use <code>Session &gt; Rename</code> to give your session a new name. A dialog will appear to ask you for the new name.</p>
<p>This operation does <strong>not</strong> make a new session folder - the existing session folder and relevant contents are renamed. If your session was not saved before a rename operation, it will be saved automatically and then renaming will continue.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ardour has no "Save As" operation that actually makes a new copy of the session folder and its contents. </p></blockquote>
