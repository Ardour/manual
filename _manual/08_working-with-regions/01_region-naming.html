title: Region Naming
---                        


  
  
<p>Regions are initially named using either:</p>
<ul>
<li>    the name of the playlist for which they were recorded
</li>
<li>    the name of the track for which they were recorded
</li>
<li>    the name of the embedded/imported file they represent
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Whole File Region Names</h3>
<p>These are not audio files, but regions that represent the full extent of an audio file. Every time a new recording is done, or a new file is embedded/imported, a new region is created that represents the entire audio file(s) This region will have the name of the track/playlist/original file, followed by a "-" and then a number plus a dot and then a number.</p>
<p>For recorded regions, the number will increase each time a new recording is made. So, for example, if there is a playlist called "Didgeridoo", the first recorded whole file region for that playlist will be called "Digderidoo-1". The next one will be "Digeridoo-2" and so on.</p>
<p>For imported/embedded files, the region name will be based on the file name, but with any final suffix (e.g. ".wav" or ".aiff") removed.</p>
<p>Normally, whole file regions are not inserted into tracks/playlists, but regions derived from them are. The whole-file versions live in the editor region list where they act as an organizing mechanism for regions that are derived from them.</p>
<h3>Normal Region Names</h3>
<p>When a region is inserted into a track/playlist, its initial name will end in a version number, such as ".1" or ".103". For a recorded region, if the whole file region was "Hang drum-1", then the region in the track will appear with the name "Hang drum-1.1". For an imported/embedded region, if the whole file region was "Bach:Invention3", then the region in the track will appear with the name "Bach:Invention3.1".</p>
<h3>Copied Region Names</h3>
<p>If you copy a region, it initially shares the same name as the original. When you perform an operation modifies one of the copies, Ardour will increment the version number on the particular copy that changed.</p>
<h3>Renaming Regions</h3>
<p>You can rename a region at any time. Use the region context menu to popup the Rename dialog. The new name does not need to have a version number in it (in fact, it probably should not). Ardour will add a version number in the future if needed (e.g. if you copy or split the region).</p>
