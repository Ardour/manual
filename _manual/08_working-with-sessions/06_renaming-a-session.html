<p>
  Use <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Rename</kbd> to give your session a 
  new name. A dialog will appear to ask you for the new name.
</p>
<p>
  This operation does <strong>not</strong> make a new session folder &mdash;
   the existing session folder and relevant contents are renamed. If your 
   session was not saved before a rename operation, it will be saved 
   automatically and then renaming will continue.
 </p>
<p class="warning">
  Ardour's <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Save As</kbd> operation will not
  make a new copy of the session folder and its contents. All it does is
  create a new session file.
</p>
