title: Adding Tracks, Busses and VCAs
---                        

<img class="right" src="/images/add-track-or-bus.png" alt="the add-track dialog" />
<p>A track, bus or VCA can be added to a session in various ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose <kbd class="menu">Track &gt; Add Track, Bus or VCA...</kbd>.</li>
  <li><kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd>-click in an empty part of the track controls area.</li>
  <li>Click the <kbd class="menu">Plus (+)</kbd> button underneath the list of tracks in the mixer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Any of these actions will open the Add Track/Bus/VCA dialog.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Add</dt>
  <dd>Here you can select the number of tracks, busses or VCAs you wish to create, and
  their <a href="/working-with-tracks/track-types/">types</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Name</dt>  
  <dd>Defines the name of the new track(s). If multiple tracks are created, or if a track with the same name already exists, a space and number will be happened at the end (e.g. : Audio 1, Audio 2...)</dd>
  <dt>Configuration</dt>
  <dd>This menu lets you choose from a number of route templates, which determine the number of input ports and optionally contain plugins and other mixer strip configuration. The most common choices here are <em>mono</em> and <em>stereo</em>.</dd>
  <dt>Record mode</dt>
  <dd>This option is only available for audio tracks and affects how it behaves when recording. See <a href="/working-with-tracks/track-types/#trackmodes">Track Modes</a> for details.</dd>
  <dt>Instrument</dt>
  <dd>This option is only available for MIDI tracks and busses and lets you select a
  default instrument from the list of available plugins.</dd>
  <dt>Group</dt>
  <dd>Tracks and busses can be assigned groups so that a selected range of 
  operations are applied to all members of a group at the same time (selecting 
  record enable, or editing, for example). This option lets you assign to an 
  existing group, or create a new group.</dd>
  <dt>Insert</dt>
  <dd>Defines where in the track list is the track created. The default is <em>Last</em>, i.e. after all the tracks and busses, and can also be <em>First</em>, <em>Before Selection</em> (to place it just above the selected track) or <em>After selection</em>.</dd>
  <dt>Output Ports</dt>
  <dd>Defines how the number of output responds to adding a plugin with a different number of outputs than the track itself. in <em>Strict I/O</em> mode, the track will only use a few of the plugins I/O and will keep its own number of output fixed, while in <em>lexible I/O</em> mode, it will automatically adapt to the I/O of its plugins. See <a href="/signal-routing/signal-flow/">Signal flow</a> to learn more about those options.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
  New tracks appear in both the editor and mixer windows. The editor window 
  shows the timeline, with any recorded data, and the mixer shows just the 
  processing elements of the track (its plugins, fader and so on).

<h2>Removing Tracks and Busses</h2>
<p>
  To <dfn>remove</dfn> tracks and busses, select them, <kbd
  class="mouse">right</kbd>-click and choose <kbd
  class="menu">Remove</kbd> 
  from the menu. A warning dialog will pop up, as track removal cannot be undone; 
  use this option with care!
