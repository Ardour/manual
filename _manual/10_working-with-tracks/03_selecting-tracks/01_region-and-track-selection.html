title: Region and Track Selection
---                        


  
  <p>By default, selecting regions has no impact on track selection. You can select a track, then select a region in another track (or vice versa) and both selections will co-exist happily. Operations that are applied to tracks will use the track selection, and those that apply to regions will use the region selection. Similarly, deselecting a region will not deselect the track it is in (if that track was selected).</p>
<p>In some workflows, and particularly if you have experience with other <abbr title="Digital Audio Workstation">DAW</abbr>s, this is not the most comfortable way to work. You may prefer to work in a style where selecting a region will also select the track that the region is in. Similarly, when the last selected region in a track is deselected, the track will also become unselected.</p>
<p>To control this behaviour, set <code>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Editor &gt; Link selection of regions and tracks</code>. </p>
