  <h2>Track Color</h2>
<p>New tracks in Ardour are assigned a random color from a pastel color spectrum, so they should never end up being particularly bright or particularly dark. </p>
<h3>Changing the color of specific tracks</h3>
<p>Select the tracks whose color you wish to change. Context-click (right-click) on the track header of one of them. From the context menu, select "Color". A <a href="/missing">color dialog</a> will appear. Choose the new color for the track, and click "OK" in the dialog. Every selected track will be recolored, both in the editor and mixer window.</p>
<p>Note that if you are only changing one track, context-clicking on that track's header will be enough to select it, saving the extra mouse click.</p>
<h3>Changing the color of all tracks in a group</h3>
<p>Tracks that belong to a <a href="/working-with-tracks/track-and-bus-groups">track/bus group</a> can share the color of the group by enabling the <code>Color</code> option for the group. </p>
<p>When this is enabled, you can change the color of the entire group by following the process described above for specific tracks - the new color will be used by all tracks in the group.</p>
<p>You can also explicitly change the group color by context-clicking on the group tab, selecting <code>Edit Group...</code> and then clicking on the Color selector in the dialog that is displayed. After you click "OK" in the color dialog that is provided for picking the color, all tracks in the group will be recolored to match the group color.</p>
