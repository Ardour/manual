  <p>A typical control area for a MIDI track is shown below:</p>
<p><img src="/ardour/manual/html/diagrams/typical-midi-track-controls.png" alt="midi track controls"
  /></p>
<p>To see the full set of MIDI track controls, as shown above, you need to increase the <a href="/working-with-tracks/controlling-track-appearance/track-height/">track height</a> beyond the default. MIDI tracks show only a few of the control elements when when there is insufficient vertical space.</p>
<p>A MIDI track has the same basic <a href="/working-with-tracks/audio-track-controls">controls as an audio track</a>, with the addition of two extra elements. The set of buttons below the main track controls controls the MIDI channels that should be visible in the editor. A MIDI track's data may span any number of the 16 available MIDI channels, and sometimes it is useful to view only a subset of those channels; different instruments may, for example, be put on different MIDI channels. Clicking on a channel number toggles its visibility.</p>
<p>To the right of the MIDI track controls is a representation of a piano keyboard called the ‘scroomer’. This performs a couple of functions. Firstly, the scrollbar controls the range of pitches that are visible on the track. Drag the body of the scrollbar up and down to display higher or lower pitches. Drag the scrollbar ‘handles’ to zooms in and out and increase and decrease the range of visible pitches. The piano keyboard gives a reference for the pitches visible on the track. In addition, clicking on the piano plays the corresponding MIDI note for reference. </p>
