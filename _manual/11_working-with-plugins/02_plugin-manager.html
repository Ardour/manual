<p>
  The <dfn>Plugin Manager</dfn> serves two purposes. Primarily it is used to
  control the display status of plugins. It can also be used to find and insert
  plugins into the
  <a href="/working-with-plugins/processor-box/">Processor Box</a>. It is
  displayed either by a double-click in the <dfn>Processor Box</dfn> or by
  choosing <kbd class="menu">New Plugin &gt; Plugin Manager...</kbd> from the
  <dfn>Processor Box</dfn> context menu.
</p>

<p>
  Displayed for each plugin is the status (normal, favorite, hidden),
  name, type, category, creator (author), and the number of audio and MIDI
  connections. The plugins can be sorted by clicking on a column header.

<h2>Plugin Display Status</h2>

<p>
  Click on a Fav(orite) or Hide radio button to change a plugin's display status.
  Clicking on an already selected radio button will cancel it, returning the
  plugin to the normal display status. Plugins marked as a favorite show up in
  the <dfn>Processor Box</dfn> context menu under
  <kbd class="menu">New Plugin &gt; Favorites</kbd>. Setting the hide
  radio button on a plugin will keep the plugin from showing in the
  <dfn>Processor Box</dfn> context menus
  <kbd class="menu">New Plugin &gt; By Creator</kbd> or
  <kbd class="menu">New Plugin &gt; By Category</kbd>.
</p>

<h2>Filtering Listed Plugins</h2>

<p>
  The middle of the <dfn>Plugin Manager</dfn> is used to filter the listed
  plugins. Typing into the text-box will filter the plugins based on the filter
  mode selected by drop-down box. Clicking <kbd class="button">Clear</kbd>
  empties the text-box.
</p>

<h2>Inserting Plugins in the Processor Box</h2>

<p>
  The bottom half of the plugin manager shows plugins that have been selected
  for insertion into the <dfn>Processor Box</dfn>. A plugin can be added by
  either double clicking the plugin entry in the top half, or, if already
  selected in top half, by clicking <kbd class="button">Add</kbd>.
<p>

<p>
  Plugins can be removed from the bottom half with a double click, or, if
  already selected, by clicking <kbd class="button">Remove</kbd>.
