<p>
  Since Version 4.5, Ardour has a plugin-sidebar on the top-left side of the
	Mixer Window.
	Like other elements in that sidebar it has variable height and can be hidden
	by dragging it to zero-height. If it is not visible, grab the top-handle
	and drag it down.

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
  The Plugin sidebar provides easy access to common operations.
	All interaction is done with the mouse and Drag/Drop.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The sidebar lists "favorite" plugins only.</li>
	<li>Plugins can be dragged from the sidebar to any track or bus, which will add the plugin to that track/bus at the given position.</li>
	<li>The list includes user-presets for the plugins. Dragging a preset to a given track/bus will load that preset after adding the plugin.</li>
	<li>Double-click on a plugin or preset adds the given plugin to all selected tracks/busses pre-fader. Other insert positions are available from the context menu (right click).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The sidebar also allows to manage presets and favorites.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Dragging a plugin from a track into the sidebar will add it to the "favorites" and optionally create a new preset from the current settings.</li>
	<li>The context-menu allows to delete presets or remove the plugin from the "favorite" list.</li>
	<li>Plugins in the list can be re-ordered using drag/drop. The custom order is saved.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Note, when favorites are added with the <a href="/working-with-plugins/plugin-manager">plugin-manager</a>, they are appended at the bottom of the list.
