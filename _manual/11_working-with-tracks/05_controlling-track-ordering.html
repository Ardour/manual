title: Controlling Track Ordering
---                        

<p>
  Ardour does not impose any particular ordering of tracks and busses in 
  either the editor or mixer windows. The default arrangements are as follows:
</p>
<p>
  In the <dfn>Editor</dfn>, the Master bus will always be on top unless
  hidden. Tracks and busses will appear in their initial order, from top to
  bottom. The monitor section (if used) will never be visible in the editor
  window.
</p>
<p>
  In the <dfn>Mixer</dfn>, the tracks and busses will be displayed in their
  initial order, from left to right. The Master bus is always on the far
  right and occupies its own pane, so that it is always visible no matter
  how you scroll the other mixer strips. If a Monitor section is used, 
  it shows up at the right edge of the mixer window, from where it can be
  torn off into a separate window.
