title: Reordering Tracks
---                        

<p>
  The <dfn>track ordering</dfn> of the Editor and Mixer is <dfn>synchronized</dfn>: if you 
  reorder in one window, the ordering in the other window will follow.
</p>

<h2>Reordering in the Editor Window</h2>
<p>
  Select the tracks you want to move. Then use<br />
  <kbd class="menu">Track &gt; Move Selected Tracks Up</kbd>
  (shortcut: <kbd class="mod1">&uarr;</kbd>) or<br />
  <kbd class="menu">Track &gt; Move Selected Tracks Down</kbd>
  (shortcut: <kbd class="mod1">&darr;</kbd>).
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, you can use the <kbd class="menu">Tracks &amp; Busses</kbd> 
  panel of the
  <a href="/ardours-interface/introducing-the-editor-window/editor-lists/">Editor
  Lists</a>, if visible.  
  Here, you can freely drag-and-drop tracks and busses into any order you prefer.
</p>

<h2>Reordering in the Mixer Window</h2>
<p>
  Within the <kbd class="menu">Strips</kbd> pane at the top left of the
  Mixer window, you can freely drag-and-drop tracks and busses into any
  desired order.
</p>

<h2>"Collecting" Group Members</h2>
<p>
  Tracks and Busses that are members of a group can be reordered so that they 
  display contiguously within the Editor and Mixer windows. Context-click on 
  the group tab and choose <kbd class="menu">Collect</kbd>.
</p>

<h2>Ordering of New Tracks</h2>
<p>
  When <dfn>adding new tracks</dfn>, the current selection determines their 
  placement. New tracks will be placed after the rightmost (in the mixer) or 
  bottom-most (in the editor) selected track. If no tracks are selected, new 
  tracks will be added at the end.
</p>
<p class="note">
  Because new tracks are automatically selected, you can quickly reorder them 
  in the editor window via the keyboard shortcuts after adding them (see above).
