title: Track Ordering and Remote Control IDs
---                        
  
<p>
  Every track and bus in Ardour is assigned a <dfn>remote control ID</dfn>. 
  When a <a href="/using-control-surfaces/">control surface</a> or any other
  remote control is used to control Ardour, these IDs are used to identify 
  which track(s) or buss(es) are the intended target of incoming commands.
</p>
<p>
  By default, remote IDs will be assigned to tracks and busses in the order 
  that they are created, starting from 1. The master bus and monitor section 
  have their own unique IDs (318 and 319).
</p>
<p>
  Ardour provides two methods to control remote control IDs, which can be 
  chosen via <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Control Surfaces
  &gt; Control surface remote ID</kbd>:
</p>
<dl class="wide-table">
  <dt>follows order of mixer</dt>
  <dd>This will reset the remote control IDs to match the mixer and editor 
  track order order, starting with rcID 1. Manual assignment of rcIDs is 
  not possible.</dd>
  <dt>assigned by user</dt>
  <dd>When enabled, the remote control ID is completely independent of the 
  ordering in either window, and may be changed manually by the user via the
  <kbd class="menu"><em>trackname</em> &gt; Remote Control ID...</kbd>
  dialog in each mixer strip.
  </dd>
</dl>
