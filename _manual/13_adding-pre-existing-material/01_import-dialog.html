<p>
  Many sessions will require the use of <dfn>existing material</dfn>,
  whether it consists of audio and/or MIDI data. Using existing samples,
  loops and riffs from files stored on your system can be the basis for
  a new session, or a way to deepen and improve one that is already
  underway.
</p>
<p>
  You can import audio and MIDI data into your session with the
  <dfn>Add Existing Media</dfn> dialog.

<h2>The Soundfile Information Box</h2>
<p>
  This box will display information about the currently selected file:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>number of channels,</li>
  <li>sample rate,</li>
  <li>file format,</li>
  <li>length,</li>
  <li>embedded timestamp (applies to some professional formats such as
  Broadcast WAVE), and</li>
  <li>tags (attached metadata to help categorize files in a library).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If the sample rate differs from the current session rate, it is displayed
  in red, which indicates that the file must be resampled before
  importing.<br />
  Resampling is controlled by the <kbd class="menu">Conversion quality</kbd>
  option described below.
</p>

<h2>Auditioner</h2>
<p>
  Files can be auditioned before importing. The slider under the play and
  stop buttons allows you to scrub around, a fader on the right side allows
  you to control the playback volume.
</p>

<h2>Importing options</h2>
<p>
  You can import files into new, automatically created tracks, to the region
  list (from where you can manually drag them into a track), or as new
  <a href="/working-with-tracks/track-types/">Tape tracks</a> with the
  <kbd class="menu">Add new files as...</kbd> option.
</p>
<p>
  New files will be inserted at either the file timestamp (if available,
  zero by default), at the <a href="/ardours-interface/the-edit-point-control/">edit point</a>, at the
  playhead, or at the start of the session, as specified in <kbd
  class="menu">Insert at...</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
  The Channel <kbd class="menu">mapping</kbd> is either "one track/region per
  file", or "one track/region per channel". The latter splits multichannel
  source files into mono regions.<br />
  If you have selected multiple files and are importing them into a track,
  you can also choose whether to sequence all files into a single track in
  the order of selection, or to create as many tracks as there are files to
  import.
</p>
<p>
  The <kbd class="menu">Conversion quality</kbd> drop-down controls the
  quality of the resampling process, if the sampling rate of the source file
  differs from the session rate.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, and most importantly, you can decide whether to <kbd
  class="option">Copy files to session</kbd>, or to link them. Please read
  <a href="/adding-pre-existing-material/copying-versus-linking/">Copying
  versus Linking</a> for details.
