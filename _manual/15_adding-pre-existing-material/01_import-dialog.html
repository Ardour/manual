<p>
  Many sessions will require the use of <dfn>existing material</dfn>,
  whether it consists of audio and/or MIDI data. Using existing samples,
  loops and riffs from files stored on your system can be the basis for
  a new session, or a way to deepen and improve one that is already
  underway.
</p>
<p>
  Importing audio and MIDI data into the session is done with the
  <dfn>Add Existing Media</dfn> dialog, accessed by the <kbd class="menu">
  Session &gt; Import</kbd> menu.
</p>

<h2>The Soundfile Information Box</h2>
<p>
  This box will display information about the currently selected file:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>number of channels,</li>
  <li>sample rate,</li>
  <li>file format,</li>
  <li>length,</li>
  <li>embedded timestamp (applies to some professional formats such as
  Broadcast WAVE), and</li>
  <li><a href="/adding-pre-existing-material/searching-for-files-using-tags/">tags</a> (attached metadata to help categorize files in a library).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If the sample rate differs from the current session rate, it is displayed
  in red, which indicates that the file must be resampled before
  importing.
</p>
<p>
  Resampling is controlled by the <kbd class="menu">Conversion quality</kbd>
  option described below.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h2>Auditioner</h2>
<p>
  Files can be auditioned before importing. The slider under the play and
  stop buttons allows you to scrub around, a fader on the right side allows
  to control the playback volume.
</p>
<p>
  Auditionning MIDI files requires a MIDI instrument to be chosen in the <kbd class="menu">
  Instrument</kbd> dropdown list.
</p>

<h2>Importing options</h2>
<p>
  Through the <kbd class="menu">Add files...</kbd> option, imported files can be inserted in the session:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>as new tracks</dt><dd>automatically creates new tracks and import the files in it</dd>
  <dt>to region list</dt><dd>adds the files to the <a href="/ardours-interface/editor-lists/region-list/">region list</a>, from where then can be manually dragged into a track</dd>
  <dt>as new tape tracks</dt><dd>adds the files as <a href="/working-with-tracks/track-types/">Tape tracks.</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>
  The <kbd class="menu">Insert at</kbd> option chooses where in time the file will be imported, amongst:
</p>
</ul>
  <li>the <dfn>file timestamp</dfn> (if available, zero by default)</li>
  <li>at the <a href="/ardours-interface/the-edit-point-control/"><dfn>edit point</dfn></a></li>
  <li>at the <dfn>playhead</dfn></li>
  <li>at the <dfn>session start</dfn>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Channel <kbd class="menu">Mapping</kbd> option is only available for
  multi-channel files (i.e. all but mono ones). It is either
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>one track/region per file</dt><dd>Creates a multi channel track for each imported file</dd>
  <dt>one track/region per channel</dt><dd>Creates only mono channels, as many as there are channels in the imported files</dd>
  <dt>sequence files</dt><dd>If multiple files are imported, they can be sequenced into a single track in the order of selection</dd>
</dl>
<p>
  The <kbd class="menu">Conversion quality</kbd> drop-down controls the
  quality of the resampling process, if the sampling rate of the source file
  differs from the session rate.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, and most importantly, the the files can be linked or copied to the session
  with the <kbd class="option">Copy files to session</kbd> checkbox. Please read
  <a href="/adding-pre-existing-material/copying-versus-linking/">Copying
  versus Linking</a> for details.
