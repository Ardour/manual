  title="http://www.freesound.org"><dfn>Freesound</dfn></a> 
  is an online repository of searchable sound files licensed under
  Creative-Commons term. The <kbd class="menu">Search  Freesound</kbd> tab 
  of the import dialog allows you to search the Freesound database, 
  and to download and audition files directly.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Tags</dt>
  <dd>Enter metadata tags that you would like to search for. You may enter 
  multiple search terms separated by spaces. For example, 
  <kbd class="input">drums 120bpm</kbd> will search for files that are tagged 
  <samp>drums</samp>, <samp>120bpm</samp>, or both.</dd>
  <dt>Sort</dt>
  <dd>Choosing one of the sort options will cause Freesound to return the list 
  of available files sorted accordingly. This can save time if you know (for 
  example) the sound you need is very short.</dd>
  <dt>Search</dt>
  <dd>Click this button to initiate the search. Freesound will begin returning 
  pages of information, with 20 items per page. The <kbd
  class="menu">Stop</kbd> button interrupts the download.</dd>
  <dt>The file list</dt>
  <dd>Click on a file to download it from Freesound. Double-click the file to 
  auto-play it in the auditioner.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
  Files imported with Freesound will automatically include any tags that are 
  associated with the file, and these tags will be included in a search when 
  you use the <kbd class="menu">Search Tags</kbd> tab.
