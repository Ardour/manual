title: Edit Point
---                        


  
  <p>Editing operations in a DAW like Ardour can be broken down according to how many points on the timeline are required to carry the operation out. Splitting a region for example, requires just one position on the timeline (the one where the split will happen). Cutting out a time range requires two positions, one for the start of the cut and one for the end. </p>
<p>In Ardour the <code>edit point</code> is the location where most single-point editing operations take place. It can be defined as one of the 3 possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li> the playhead
</li>
<li> the position of the pointer (mouse or touch)
</li>
<li> the selected marker
</li>
</ul>
<p>The default edit point is the location of the pointer. </p>
<p>There are 2 keybindings available to cycle through the edit point options; the most common workflow tends to involve just switching back and forth between edit point = playhead and edit point = mouse (default `). Another binding ^ will cycle through all three choices (including the selected marker).  You can also switch the edit point using a combo-selector just right of the snap/grid unit selector.</p>
<h3>The Implict Range</h3>
<p>In addition to explicit range selections made with the Range tool, Ardour also provides an implicit edit range. This edit range can be very useful if you want to edit by ear, rather than by mouse. If there is no regions selected, and no explicit range selection, then any editing operations that require a range (such as separate) will use the implicit edit range.</p>
<p>The implicit range is the area between the current edit point and some other position. In most cases it is either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The area between the mouse and the playhead <strong>OR</strong>
</li>
<li>The area between a selected marker and the mouse or playhead
</li>
</ul>
<p>Which of these is true depends on which edit point setting you are using (Mouse, Playhead or Marker) and whether<br>
there is a selected marker at that time.</p>
