title: Common Region Editing Operations
---                        


  
  
<p>This section covers a set of region editing operations that you are likely to use again and again while working on a session. Depending on your work habits (and experience of other <abbr title="Digital Audio Workstation">DAW</abbr>s) you'll find some of these operations critical while others used only rarely. </p>
<p>You can carry out all of these operations from the keyboard (see <a href="/default-keyboard-bindings">Default Keyboard Shortcuts</a> for a list). Equivalent operations can be done with mouse in most cases. </p>
<p>You may want to review your understanding of <a href="/editing-and-arranging/the-edit-point">the edit point/range</a> and <a href="/editing-and-arranging/what-regions-are-affected">which regions will be affected by region operations</a>.</p>
