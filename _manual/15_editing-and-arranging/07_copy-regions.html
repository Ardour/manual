  <h2>Copy a Single Region</h2>
<p>To copy a region, make sure you are in object mouse mode. Move the mouse pointer into the region <kbd class="mod1">click and drag</kbd>. Ardour creates a new region and follows the mouse pointer as it moves. See <a href="/editing-and-arranging/move-regions/">Move Regions</a> for more details on moving the copied region.</p>

<h2>Copy Multiple Regions</h2>
<p>To copy multiple regions, select them before copying. Then <kbd>click+drag</kbd> on one of the selected regions. All the regions will be copied and as they move. The copied regions will keep their positions relative to each other.</p>

<h2>Fixed-Time Copying</h2>
<p>If you want to copy region(s) to other track(s) but keep the copies at the exact position on the timeline as the originals, simply use <kbd class="mod1">Middle-click-drag</kbd> instead.</p>
