<p>A final new editing feature is an operation in the context menu of a range labelled "Separate Regions Under Range". This will split any selected regions that are covered by the range at both ends of the range (or just one, if the range only covers part of the region). This makes it easy to generate regions that correspond precisely to a range.</p>
