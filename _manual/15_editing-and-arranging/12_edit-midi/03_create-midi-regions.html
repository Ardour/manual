<p>Although recording MIDI is a common way to create new MIDI regions, it is often desirable to do so as part of editing/arranging.</p>
<p>To create a new MIDI region, simply <kbd>Left-click</kbd> in a MIDI track. A region will be created that is one bar long. You can <a href="/editing-and-arranging/changing-region-lengths">trim</a> it to any length you want.</p>
<p>Once you have created a region, you will probably want to <a href="/editing-and-arranging/edit-midi/add-new-notes">Add some notes to it</a>.</p>
