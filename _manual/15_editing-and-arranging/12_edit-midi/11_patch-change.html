<p>A ‘patch change’ is Ardour's description for a combination of MIDI program change and bank select messages, that (typically) instruct a synthesizer or sampler to select a different sound to use on a particular channel. </p>
<p>Patch changes are shown within MIDI regions as small rectangles or "flags", as shown below:</p>
<h3>Inserting Patch Changes</h3>
<p>Ensure that the <a href="/editing-and-arranging/the-edit-point">edit point</a> is located where you want the patch change to be (within an existing MIDI region). Context click, and from the MIDI region's context menu, select <code>MIDI &gt; Insert Patch Change</code>. A dialog will appear allowing you to set the bank and program values. </p>
<h3>Modifying Patch Changes</h3>
<p>Context-clicking on a patch change will bring up the same dialog that was used to create it, allowing you to modify the program and/or bank numbers.</p>
<p>You can also use the mousewheel: regular <kbd>scroll</kbd> on the patch change will alter the program number, <kbd class="mod1">scroll</kbd> will modify the bank number.</p>
<h3>Moving Patch Changes</h3>
<p>Just <kbd>Left-click-and-drag</kbd> on the patch change to move it around.</p>
<h3>Removing Patch Changes</h3>
<p>Put the mouse pointer into the rectangular area, and press <kbd>Delete</kbd> or use the delete mouse button operation. This will remove the patch change (the operation can be undone).</p>
<h3>Names for Patch Numbers: MIDNAM files</h3>
