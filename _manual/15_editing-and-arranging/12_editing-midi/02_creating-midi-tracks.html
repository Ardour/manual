title: Creating MIDI Tracks
---                        


  
  
<p>To create a new MIDI track, choose <code>Session &gt; Add Track/Bus</code>. In the Add Track/Bus dialog, pick "MIDI Track" from the combo selector at the upper right. </p>
<p>You may decide to use a <a href="/missing">track template</a> if you have one. You may also know the instrument (a plugin that will generate audio in response to receiving MIDI) that you want to use in the track. The Instrument selector will show you a list of all plugins that you have which accept MIDI input and generate audio output. </p>
