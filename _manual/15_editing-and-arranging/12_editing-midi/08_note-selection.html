  <h2>Selecting/Navigating note-by-note</h2>
<p>Tab selects the next note. <kbd class="mod1">Tab</kbd> selects the previous note. <kbd>Shift-Tab</kbd> or <kbd class="mod13">Tab</kbd> adds the next/previous note to the selection.</p>
<h2>Selecting notes with the mouse</h2>
<p>While in mouse object mode, you can click on a note to select it. Once you've selected one note, shift-click on another to select all notes between them. To add or remove a note to/fromt the selection, use <kbd class="mod1">click</kbd>. You can also click and drag outside of a note to "rubberband select" a series of notes.</p>
<p>Three different selection operations are possible if you switch to mouse range mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vertical drags within the MIDI region will select all notes within the spanned note range
</li>
<li>Clicks on the piano header of the track (if visible - the track must be tall enough to display it) will select all occurences of that note
</li>
<li>Drags on the piano header of the track will select all notes within the spanned note range
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Listening to Selected  Notes</h2>
<p>if <code>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; MIDI &gt; Sound MIDI notes as they are selected</code> is enabled, Ardour will send a pair of NoteOn/NoteOff messages through the track, which will typically allow you to hear each note as it is selected.</p>
