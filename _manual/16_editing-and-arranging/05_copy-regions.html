<h2>Copy a Single Region</h2>
<p>
  To copy a region, make sure you are in object mouse mode. Move the mouse 
  pointer into the region and <kbd class="mouse mod1">left</kbd>-drag. Ardour 
  creates a new region and follows the mouse pointer as it moves. See 
  <a href="/editing-and-arranging/move-regions/">Move Regions</a> for more 
  details on moving the copied region.
</p>

<h2>Copy Multiple Regions</h2>
<p>
  To copy multiple regions, select them before copying. Then 
  <kbd class="mouse mod1">left</kbd>-drag one of the selected regions. All the 
  regions will be copied and as they move. The copied regions will keep their 
  positions relative to each other.
</p>

<h2>Fixed-Time Copying</h2>
<p>
  If you want to copy region(s) to other track(s) but keep the copies at the 
  exact position on the timeline as the originals, simply use 
  <kbd class="mouse mod1">Middle</kbd>-drag instead.
</p>
