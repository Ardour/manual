title: Change Note Properties

<p>
  You can view all the details about a selected note by context-clicking on 
  it. The dialog that pops up will also allow you to modify all the properties 
  of the selected note(s). You can modify individual properties more efficiently 
  using the techniques described below.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Moving notes</dt>
  <dd>
    Right arrow and Left arrow move the selected note(s) early and later in time.
  </dd>
  <dt>Changing pitch values</dt>
  <dd>
    <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> increases the pitch of the selected notes.<br />
    <kbd>&darr;</kbd> reduces the pitch of the selected notes.<br />
    If any of the selected notes are already at the maximum or minimum value, 
    no changes will be made to any of the notes, to preserve relative pitches. 
    You can override this with <kbd class="mod2"> </kbd>. The default shift 
    distance is one semitone. Use <kbd class="mod3"> </kbd> to alter this to 
    one octave.
  </dd>
  <dt>Changing velocity values</dt>
  <dd>
    <kbd class="mod1">&uarr;</kbd> increases the velocity of the selected notes.
    <br/>
    <kbd class="mod1">&darr;</kbd> reduces the velocity of the selected
    notes.<br />
    If any of the selected notes are already at the maximum or minumum value, 
    no changes will be made to any of the notes, to preserve relative velocities. 
    You can override this with <kbd class="mod2"> </kbd>.
    You can also press <kbd>v</kbd> to popup a dialog that will allow you to set 
    the absolute velocity value of each selected note. Finally, the scroll wheel 
    <kbd class="mouse">&uArr;</kbd> <kbd class="mouse">&dArr;</kbd> will also 
    adjust notes in the same way as the arrow keys (note that like the arrow keys 
    it only affects selected notes, not the note the pointer is over). 
  </dd>
  <dt>Changing channel</dt>
  <dd>
    Press <kbd>c</kbd> to bring up a dialog that allow you to see and alter the 
    MIDI channel of the selected notes. If the selected notes use different 
    channels, they will all be forced to the newly selected channel.
  </dd>
  <dt>Changing start/end/duration</dt>
  <dd>
    <kbd>,</kbd> (comma) will alter the start time of the note. <br />
    <kbd>.</kbd> (period) will alter the end time of the note. Both keys will by 
    default make the note longer (either by moving the start earlier or the end 
    later). For the opposite effect, use <kbd class="mod1">,</kbd>/<kbd
    class="mod1">.</kbd>. The note will be altered by the current grid setting. 
    To change the start/end positions by 1/128th of a beat, use the <kbd
    class="mod2"> </kbd> modifier in addition to these shortcuts.
  </dd>
  <dt>Quantization</dt>
  <dd>
    <kbd>q</kbd> will quantize the selected notes using the current quantize 
    settings. If the quantize settings have not been set for this session yet, 
    the quantize dialog will appear. <kbd class="mod2">q</kbd> will display the 
    quantize dialog to allow you to reset the quantize settings, and then 
    quantizes the selected notes. The default quantize settings are: quantize 
    note starts to the current grid setting, no swing, no threshold, full 
    strength.
  </dd>
  <dt>Step Entry, Quantize etc.</dt>
