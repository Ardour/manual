title: Separate Range

<p>
  A final new editing feature is an operation in the context menu of a 
  range labelled <kbd class="menu">Separate Regions Under Range</kbd>. 
  This splits any selected regions that are covered by the range at both 
  ends of the range (or just one, if the range only covers part of the 
  region). This makes it easy to generate regions that correspond 
  precisely to a range.
