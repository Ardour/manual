<p>
When you have finished mixing your session, you probably want to export it to a sound 
file to burn to a CD, upload to the web, or whatever. <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Export &gt; Export to Audio file(s)...</kbd>
shows the Export Dialog to do this.
     
</p>
<p>
You can also export the outputs of multiple tracks &amp; busses all at once via 
<kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Export &gt; Stem Export...</kbd>.
</p>

<h2>File Format</h2>
<img src="/images/export-dialog-file-format.png" />
<p>
This tab contains controls for the format of the exported audio file.
You can enable more than one format here, in which case each will be exported in turn.
Ardour is supplied with a list of export formats, including:
<ul>
<li>CD (Red Book)</li>
<li>DVD-A</li>
<li>FLAC 24 bit </li>
<li>FLAC 24 bit (tagged)</li>
<li>Ogg_Vorbis</li>
<li>Ogg_Vorbis (tagged)</li>
<li>Ring Tone</li>
</ul>
You can edit these formats, or create your own, with the <a href="/exporting/edit-export-format-profile/">"Edit Export Format Profile"</a> dialog, which
appears when you click the "Edit" or "New" button to the right of the drop-down list of formats.
</p>

<p>
You can also create a 'Preset' consisting of one or more formats. Ardour provides some ready-made presets, too:

<ul>
<li>CD + DVD-A</li>
<li>CD + FLAC</li>
<li>CD + FLAC (tagged)</li>
<li>CD + Ogg_Vorbis + FLAC (tagged)</li>
<li>CD + Ogg_Vorbis</li>
<li>CD + Ogg_Vorbis (tagged)</li>
<li>CD only</li>
<li>DVD-A only</li>
<li>FLAC</li>
<li>FLAC (tagged)</li>
<li>Ogg_Vorbis + FLAC</li>
<li>Ogg_Vorbis + FLAC (tagged)</li>
<li>Ogg_Vorbis </li>
<li>Ogg_Vorbis (tagged)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Soundcloud upload</h3>
<p>
When 'Upload to Soundcloud' is ticked on in any format's tab, a pane containing fields
to enter in Soundcloud account details (email and password), and what should happen
to the uploaded files will become visible.
</p>

<p>
<dl>
<dt>Make files public</dt><dd>Choose whether to make uploaded files available to anyone via the Soundcloud web site.</dd>
<dt>Open uploaded files in browser</dt><dd>Open each file on soundcloud in your browser after upload. 
If you don't enable this, you can still see the URLs in the <a href="">Log window</a>.</dd>
<dt>Make files downloadable</dt><dd>Choose whether to allow downloading of files uploaded to Soundcloud.</dd>
</dl>
</p>




<h2>Time Span</h2>
<img src="/images/export-dialog-timespan.png" />
<p>
This tab allows you to select the range (or ranges) of the timeline to export. By default, "session" is
enabled - this will export the whole session from the start marker to the end marker.
</p>


<h2>Channels</h2>
<img src="/images/export-dialog-channels.png" />
<p>
Here you can choose which outputs (tracks or busses) should be sent to the exported file.
</p>

<h2>Stem Export</h2>
<img src="/images/export-dialog-stem-export.png" />
<p>
If you chose 'Stem Export', the 'Channels' tab appears slightly differently:
in this case each chosen channel (track or bus) is exported to its own file,
instead of all channels being mixed together into a single file. You can
choose to export either the region contents or the track output here in this
case.
