title: Panning
---                        

<p>
  <dfn>Panning</<dfn> is the process of distributing one or more signals
  across a series of outputs so that the listener will have the
  experience of them coming from a particular point or area of the
  overall listening field.
</p>
<p>
  It is used to create a sense of space and/or a sense of motion in an
  audio mix. You can spread out different signals across the space, and
  make them move over time.
</p>

<h2>Types of Panners</h2>
<p>
  The way a panner works depends a great deal on how many signals it
  is going to process and how many outputs it will send them to. The
  simplest case is distributing a single signal to 2 outputs, which is
  the common case when using a "mono" track and a stereo speaker
  setup.
</p>
<p>
  But panning in Ardour could theoretically involve distributing any
  number of signals to any number of ouputs. In reality, Ardour does
  not have specific panners for each different situation. Currently,
  it has dedicated panners for the following situations:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 signal distributed to 2 outputs (the mono panner)</li>
    <li>2 signals distributed to 2 outputs (the stereo panner)</li>
    <li>N signals distributed to M outputs (the VBAP panner)</li>
  </ul>
<p>  
  Even for each of these cases, there are many different ways to
  implement panning. Ardour currently offers just one solution to each
  of these situations, but in the future will offer more.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the panners, Ardour has a balance control for subtle
  corrections to existing stereo images.
