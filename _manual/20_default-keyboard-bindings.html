title: Default Keyboard Bindings
---                        


  
  
<p>Almost every available function in Ardour can be executed via a keyboard shortcut (or OSC command). There are many more functions available than there are keys on even the largest current computer keyboards, so only a subset of them are bound to keys by default.</p>

<p>Ardour comes with a rich set of default bindings. The default bindings are "mnemonic" in that they focus on trying use to
the letter that starts the name of an operation as the binding for
that operation. This is not always possible, but it acts as a general
rule. This does not necessarily lead to the best ergonomics for rapid
editing - there are alternative binding sets for that - but it does
make it simpler for newcomers to remember some of the most common
bindings (e.g. "s" for "Split", "p" for "position playhead").</p>

<p>Almost every key binding ("shortcut") in Ardour can be changed. From the main menu choose <code>Window > Key Bindings</code>.</p>

<p>The conventions for using modifier keys (Control, Alt, Command
etc.) differ from platform to platform, so we provide different
bindings for each platform.</p>
