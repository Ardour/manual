<p>
  This will walk you through the process of configuring and using 
  a MIDI control surface with Ardour that uses the <dfn>Mackie Control
  protocol</dfn> (MCP) or <dfn>Logic Control protocol</dfn>. Devices that 
  have been tested and are known to work include the SSL Nucleus, Mackie 
  Control Pro (plus extenders), Behringer devices in Mackie/Logic mode, 
  and Steinberg CMC devices.
</p>

<h2>Enabling Mackie Control in Ardour</h2>
<p>
  Navigate to <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Control Surfaces</kbd>. Double-click on <kbd class="menu">Mackie Control</kbd>
  to see the setup dialog:
</p>
<img src="" alt="Mackie Control Setup Dialog" />
<p>
  From the selector at the top, choose the type of device you are using. 
  (<a href="/missing">What do do if your device is not listed</a>).
</p>
<p>
  Once your setup is complete, click "OK" to close the dialog. Now click 
  on the enable checkbox for "Mackie Control".
</p>

<h2>Connecting control surface and Ardour MIDI ports</h2>
<p>
  If you are using a device that uses ipMIDI, such as the SSL Nucleus, no 
  MIDI port connections are required &mdash; Ardour and your control 
  surface will be able to talk to each other automatically.
</p>
<p>
  If you are using a device that uses normal MIDI (via a standard MIDI or 
  USB cable), you need to connect Ardour's Mackie Control in and out ports 
  to the MIDI ports leading to and coming from the control surface.
</p>
<p>
  When you have made these connections once, Ardour will recreate them 
  for you in the future, as long as you leave Mackie Control enabled.
</p>

<h2>Customizing your control surface</h2>
<p>
  Every possible Mackie Control button can be bound to any action present 
  in Ardour's GUI. Please check your control surface page for suggestions.
</p>

<h2>Preparing your device for use with Ardour</h2>
<p>
  Most interfaces will require some configuration to send and respond to 
  MCP.
