<p>This will walk you through the process of configuring and using a MIDI control surface with Ardour that uses the Mackie Control protocol or the Logic Control protocol. Devices that have been tested and are known to work include the SSL Nucleus, Mackie Control Pro (plus extenders), Behringer devices in Mackie/Logic mode, and Steinberg CMC devices.</p>
<p>See the bottom of this page for links to device-specific information.</p>
<h2>Preparing your device for use with Ardour</h2>
<p>Each interface model probably has some necessary setup so it's in the state Ardour expects to identify it. See your control surface page to see what's necessary. If there is no page about your control surface, create one!</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>Please see the platform specific pages for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/using-control-surfaces/devices-using-mackielogic-control-protocol/mackie-control-setup-on-linux">Linux</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/missing">OS X</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enabling Mackie Control in Ardour</h2>
<p>Navigate to <code>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Control Surfaces</code>. Check the "Enabled" box, then double-click on "Mackie Control" to see the setup dialog:</p>
<p><img src="" alt="Mackie Control Setup Dialog"></p>
<p>From the selector at the top, choose the type of device you are using. (<a href="/missing">What do do if your device is not listed</a>). </p>
<p>Once your setup is complete, click "OK" to close the dialog. Now click on the enable checkbox for "Mackie Control". </p>
<h2>Connecting control surface and Ardour MIDI ports</h2>
<p>If you are using a device that uses ipMIDI such as the SSL Nucleus, no MIDI port connections are required - Ardour and your control surface will be able to talk to each other automatically.</p>
<p>If you are using a device that uses "normal" MIDI (via a standard MIDI or USB cable), you need to connect Ardour's Mackie Control ports to the MIDI ports corresponding to the control surface.</p>
<p>Now that you have both control surface and Ardour MIDI ports available, cross connect the control surface MIDI ports and the two mackie ports.</p>
<p>Once you have made these connections once, Ardour will recreate them when it is started in the future (as long as you leave Mackie Control enabled as a control protocol).</p>
<h2>Customizing your control surface</h2>
<p>Every possible Mackie Control button can be found to any action present in Ardour's GUI. </p>
<p>Please check your control surface page for suggestions.</p>
