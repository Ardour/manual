<h2>Behringer BCF-2000 Faders Controller</h2> 
<p>

</p>
<p>
  The Behringer BCF-2000 Fader Controller is a control surface with 8 motorized 
  faders, 8 rotary encoders and 30 push buttons. The device is a class
  compliant USB Midi Interface and also has standard Midi DIN IN/OUT/THRU  ports.
  The device has included a Mackie/Logic Control Emulation Mode since firmware v1.06.
  If you're devices firmware is older than v1.06 it will require an update before
  Mackie Control Emulation will work as described here.
</p>

</p>

<p>
  In order to put the controller into Mackie/Logic control mode turn on the 
  unit while holding third button from the left in the top most row
  of buttons (under the rotary encoder row). Hold the button down until <dfn>EG</dfn>
  or edit global mode is displayed on the LCD screen of the unit. The global parameters
  can then be edited using the 8 rotary encoders in the top row. 
</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>
      Encoder #1 sets the operating mode and should be set to <dfn>U-1</dfn> or
      USB mode 1 if using with a USB cable connection.
    </li></code>
    <li><code>
      Encoder #3 sets the foot switch mode and should most likely be set to
      <dfn>Auto</dfn> to detect how the foot switch is wired. 
    </li></code>
    <li><code>
      Encoder #5 sets the device id, if you are using only 1 device the id
      should be set to <dfn>ID 1</dfn>. If you are using multiple BCF/BCR2000 each
      device is required to be set up sequentially and one at a time.
    </li></code>
    <li><code>      
      Encoder #7 controls the MIDI <dfn>Dead Time</dfn> or the amount of milliseconds
      after a move has been made that the device ignores further changes, this 
      should be set to <dfn>100</dfn>.
    </li></code>
    <li><code>
      Encoder #8 controls the MIDI message <dfn>Send Interval</dfn> in milliseconds
      and should be set to <dfn>10</dfn>
    </li></code>
  </ul>
<p>
  To exit the <dfn>EG</dfn> mode press the <dfn>Exit</dfn> button. The device is now
  ready to use with Ardour.

<h3>Modes of Operation</h3>
<p>
  <img alt="Digramatic Image of the BCF2000 Control Modes"
     src="/images/BCF2000-Modes.png">
</p>
<p>
  The four buttons arranged in a rectangle and located under the Behringer logo 
  are the mode selection buttons in Logic Control Emulation Mode,
  currently Ardour has implemented support for two of these modes.
</p>
<p>
The surface can be broken into 8 groups of controls.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The rotary encoders at the top of the device</li>
  <li>The first row of buttons under the encoders</li>
  <li>The second row of buttons under the encoders</li>
  <li>The row of motorized faders<li>
  <li>
    The group of 4 buttons at the top right that will be
    referred to here as the <dfn>Shift Group</dfn>
  </li>
  <li>
    The group of 4 buttons under the <dfn>Shift Group</dfn>
    referred to here as the <dfn>Mode Group</dfn>

  <li>
    The group of 2 buttons under the <dfn>Mode Group</dfn>
    referred to here as the <dfn>Select Group</dfn>
  </li>

<h3>Mixer Pan Mode</h3>
<p>
  <img alt="Digramatic Image of the BCF2000 Control Modes"
     src="/images/BCF2000-Pan.png">
</p>
<p>
  This is the standard work mode that organizes the control surface to emulate
  a standard mixer layout where controls for each track/bus are arranged vertically.
  The order of the faders is either controlled by the order of the tracks in the
  mixer or can be set manually by the user.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Encoders</dt>
  <dd>Mixer Pans. The red LEDs show the amount of pan left or right</dd>
  <dt>First Row of Buttons</dt>
  <dd>Mixer Mutes. The button led lights if the track is currently muted</dd>
  <dt>Second Row of Buttons</dt>
  <dd>Select Active Track/Bus. Currently selected track/bus is indicated by the button led</dd>
  <dt>Faders</dt>
  <dd>Mixer Gains</dd>
  <dt>Shift Group</dt>
  <dd>
    The top and bottom left buttons are the simply shifts to change the function of other buttons
  </dd>
  <dd>
    The top right is the <dfn>Fine Control</dfn> button that allows the increment values sent by
    by rotary encoders and faders to be a small value for more precise editing. This button
    can also act as a shift button.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    The bottom right is the <dfn>Global Shift</dfn> button that allows you to change back to the
    standard Mixer Pan view from other views and modes. This button can also act as a shift button.
  </dd>
  <dt>Mode Group</dt>
  <dd>The top two buttons functions are not currently implemented in Ardour.</dd>
  <dd>The bottom left button sets the device to <dfn>Pan</dfn> mode and should currently be lit</dd>
  <dd>
    The bottom right button sets the device to <dfn>Send</dfn> mode but will only allow the switch
    if the currently selected track/bus has a send or sends to control.
  </dd>
  <dt>Select Group</dt>
  <dd>
    In this mode they function as bank select left and right. If your session has more than 8 tracks
    the next set of 8 tracks is selected with the right button and the faders will move to match the
    current gain settings of that bank of 8 tracks/busses. If the last bank contains less than 8 
    tracks/busses the unused  faders will move to the bottom and the pan lights will all turn
    off. An unlimited amount of tracks can be controlled with the device.
  </dd>
  <dt>Transport Group</dt>
  <dd>The upper left button controls <dfn>Rewind<dfn>.
  <dd>The upper right button controls <dfn>Fast Foreword</dfn>
  <dd>The lower left button controls stop</dd>
  <dd>The lower right button controls play</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Send Mode</h3>
<p>
  <img alt="Digramatic Image of the Send Mode"
     src="/images/BCF2000-Send.png">
</p>
<p>
  Send mode allows for the top row of encoders to control the sends for a selected channel.
  One interesting option is to flip the controls from the encoders to the faders by pressing
  the shift 1 button and the global view button at the same time.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Encoders</dt>
  <dd>
    In send mode, the encoders control sends from left to right instead of mixer pans.
    If there are less than 8 sends the behavior of the encoder will be to continue controlling
    the mixer pan. Visually it's indicated by the change in the LED from originating at the 12
    o'clock position to originating at the 7 o'clock position. If <dfn>FLIP</dfn> is pressed 
    the encoder will control the mixer gain for the selected track/bus.
  </dd>
  <dt>First row of buttons</dt>
  <dd>No Change</dd>
  <dt>Second row of buttons</dt>
  <dd>No Change.</dd>
  <dt>Faders</dt>
  <dd>
    No change unless <dfn>FLIP</dfn>is pressed then it controls the send for the selected track/bus.

<h3>Mixer Pan While Holding Shift 1</h3>
<p>
  <img alt="Digramatic Image of the Mixer Mode while holding down shift 1"

</p>
<p>
  The operations of various buttons change while holding down the <dfn>Shift 1</dfn> button
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Encoders</dt>
  <dd>No Change</dd>
  <dt>First row of buttons</dt>
  <dd>These now control the Soloing of each track/bus in the current bank</dd>
  <dt>Second row of buttons</dt>
  <dd>These now control the Enable Record for each track</dd>
  <dt>Faders</dt>
  <dd>No Change</dd>
  <dt>Shift Group</dt>
  <dd>No change</dd>
  <dt>Mode Group</dt>
  <dd>No Change</dd>
  <dt>Select Group</dt>
  <dd>
    These now change the current bank of tracks being controlled over by
    one. So if you where controlling tracks 1-8 a push the right
    button the surface would now control tracks 2-9 pressing the left
    would then shift back to controlling tracks 1-8.
  </dd>
  <dt>Transport Group</dt>
  <dd>The upper left now controls turning on and off <dfn>Loop</dfn> mode.</dd>
  <dd>
    The upper right now toggles
    <dfn>Click</dfn>.
  </dd>
  <dd>The lower left toggles <dfn>Replace</dfn>.</dd>
  <dd>
    The lower right toggles
    <dfn>Global Record</dfn>.
