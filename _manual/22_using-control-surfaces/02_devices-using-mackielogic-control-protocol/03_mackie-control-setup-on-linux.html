  <h2>Devices using ipMIDI</h2>
<p>If you are using a device like the SSL Nucleus that uses ipMIDI, no set up is required other than to ensure that your control surface and computer are both connected to the same network.</p>
<h2>Devices using conventional MIDI</h2>
<p>Before attempting to use a Mackie Control device that communicates via a standard MIDI cable or a USB cable, you should ensure that <a href="http://manual.ardour.org/setting-up-your-system/setting-up-midi/midi-on-linux">your Linux MIDI environment is setup</a>.</p>
