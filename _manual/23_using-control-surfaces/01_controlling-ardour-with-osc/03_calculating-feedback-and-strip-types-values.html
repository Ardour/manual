title: Calculating Feedback and Strip-types Values
---                        

<p><em>/set_surface</em> has two values the user needs to calculate before
  use. In general these will not be calculated at run time, but
  beforehand. There may be more than one button with different values
  to turn various kinds of feedback on or off or to determine which
  kinds of strips are currently viewed/controlled.
</p>
<p>Both ,<em>feedback</em> and <em>strip-types</em> use bitsets to keep
  track what they are doing. Any number in a computer is made out of
  bits that are on or off, but we represent them as normal base 10
  numbers. Any one bit turned on will add a unique value to the
  number as a whole. So for each kind of feedback or strip type
  to be used, that number should be added to the total.</p>
<h3>strip_types</h3>
<p>
  strip_types is an integer made up of bits. The easy way to
  deal with this is to think of strip_types items being worth a number and
  then adding all those numbers together for a value to send.
  Strip Types will determine What kind of strips will be included in 
  bank. This would include: Audio, MIDI, busses, VCAs, Master, Monitor
  and hidden or selected strips.
</p>
  <ul>
	<li>
		1	- AudioTracks.
	</li>
	<li>
		2	- MidiTracks.
	</li>
	<li>
		4	- AudioBuses.
	</li>
	<li>
		8	- MidiBuses.
	</li>
	<li>
		16	- VCAs.
	</li>
	<li>
		32	- Master.
	</li>
	<li>
		64	- Monitor.
	</li>
	<li>
		128	- Audio Aux.
	</li>
	<li>
		256	- Selected.
	</li>
	<li>
		512	- Hidden.
	</li>
  </ul>
<p class="note">
  Selected and Hidden bits are normally not needed as Ardour defaults to
  showing Selected strips and not showing Hidden strips. The purpose of
  these two flags is to allow showing only Selected strips or only
  Hidden strips. Using Hidden with other flags will allow Hidden strips
  to show inline with other strips.
</p>
<p>
  Some handy numbers to use might be: 15 (all tracks and buses), 31
  (add VCAs to that). Master or Monitor strips are generally not useful
  on a surface that has dedicated controls for these strips as there are
  /master* and /monitor* commands already. However, on a surface with
  just a bank of fader strips, adding master or monitor would allow
  access to them within the banks. Selected would be useful for working
  on a group or a set of user selected strips. Hidden shows strips the
  GUI has hidden.
</p>
<p class-"note">
  Audio Aux? say what? I am sure most people will have noticed that they
  can find no <em>Aux</em> strips in the Ardour mixer. There are none.
  There are buses that can be used a number of ways. From analog days,
  in OSC a bus is something that gets used as a sub mix before ending up
  going to Master. An auxiliary bus is used like a separate mixer and
  it's output goes outside the program or computer to be used as:
  a monitor mix, a back up recording, or what have you. In OSC where
  controller strips may be limited, it may be useful not to use up a
  strip for an aux that is not really a part of the mix. It is also
  useful to get a list of only aux buses if the control surface is a
  phone used to provide talent monitor mix control on stage. Each
  performer would be able to mix their own monitor. The user is free
  to enable both buses and auxes if they would prefer.

<h3>feedback</h3> 
<p>Feedback is an integer made up of bits. The easy way to
  deal with this is to think of feedback items being worth a number and
  then adding all those numbers together for a value to send.
</p>
  <ul>
	<li>
		1 - Button status for strips.
	</li>
	<li>
		2 - Variable control values for strips.
	</li>
	<li>
		4 - Send SSID as path extension.
	</li>
	<li>
		8 - heartbeat to surface.
	</li>
	<li>
		16 - Enable master section feedback.
	</li>
	<li>
		32 - Send Bar and Beat.
	</li>
	<li>
		64 - Send timecode.
	</li>
	<li>
		128 - Send meter as dB (-193 to +6) or 0 to 1 depending on gainmode
	</li>
	<li>
		256 - Send meter a 16 bit value where each bit is a level
		and all bits of lower level are on. For use in a LED strip. This
		will not work if the above option is turned on.
	</li>
	<li>
		512 - Send signal present, true if level is higher than -40dB
	</li>
	<li>
		1024 - Send position in samples
	</li>
	<li>
		2048 - Send position in time, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds
	</li>
 	<li>
		8192 - Turn on extra select channel feedback beyond what a /strip supports
	</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  So using a value of 19 would turn on feedback for strip and master
  controls, but leave meters, timecode and bar/beat feedback off.
