<p>
  There are currently 5 devices preconfigured to work with extenders.
  Two of them are for one master and one extender with the master on the
  right side or master on the left side. There are three presets for a
  master and two extenders with the master on the left, in the center
  and on the right. While these files will work for many uses there may
  be cases where a custom device profile makes more sense. 
  The best way is to start with the *.device file that matches your 
  master device and copy it
  to a new name such as xt+mc.device and then edit that file. It is best to
  name the file with the order the devices are expected to be used in as
  the position of the master device is specified in this file.

  The three lines of interest are:
<p>
<pre>
 &lt;Name value="Device name"/&gt;
 &lt;Extenders value="0"/&gt;
 &lt;MasterPosition value="0"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Add any lines that are not present.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>Name</code> value should be a unique name so it is obvious
  in the list of devices.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>Extenders</code>
  value is the number of extenders used and should not include the master in
  that number.
</p>
<p>
  When an <code>Extenders</code> value of greater than 0 is used, extra midi
  ports will appear for the extenders to be connected to. The MIDI ports
  for the controllers will be named <code>mackie control #1</code>,
  <code>mackie control #2</code> and up. The numbers will go from left to
  right. That is, from lowest number channel to highest.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>MasterPosition</code> value is the port number the master unit
  (with the master fader) is connected to. So if there are three surfaces,
  <code>&lt;MasterPosition value="1"/&gt;</code> will expect the master on
  the left, <code>&lt;MasterPosition value="2"/&gt;</code> would be master
  in the middle and <code>&lt;MasterPosition value="3"/&gt;</code> would be
  master on the right. So the position matches the port name.
</p>
<p class="note">
  The default value of <code>&lt;MasterPosition value="0"/&gt;</code> has
  the same effect as <code>&lt;MasterPosition value="1"/&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>
  If the <code>MasterPosition</code> value does not properly match the
  physcal position and MIDI port, the master fader and global controls will
  not work. The master unit will act like an extender.
