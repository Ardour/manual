---                        

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The integration of a video timeline and video monitoring into Ardour 3.2 allows for convenient audio mixing and editing to video ie soundtracks, music videos, TV post production etc.
</p>
  

<p>
Ardour 3.2 (and later) facilities to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Import a single video and optionally extract the soundtrack from it.
</li>
<li>Provide a Video-monitor window, or full-screen display, of the imported video in sync with any of the available Ardour timecode sources.
</li>
<li>Display a frame-by-frame (thumbnail) timeline of the video.
</li>
<li>time-offset the video.
</li>
<li><em>Lock</em> audio-regions to the video: Move audio-regions with the video at video-frame granularity.
</li>
<li>Export the video, cut start/end, add blank frames and/or mux it with the soundtrack of the current-session.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Furthermore, the setup is modular and can be configured in different ways, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>One machine: all video decoding, video monitoring and Ardour audio
</li>
<li>Two machines: separate video-monitor and Ardour
</li>
<li>Three machines: separate video-server (for timeline decoding and file-archive), dedicated video-monitor and Ardour
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ardour does <strong>not</strong> :
</p>
<ul>
<li>allow for more than one video to be loaded at a time.
</li>
<li>provide video editing capabilities
</li>
</ul>
