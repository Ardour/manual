<h2>Adding Video</h2>

<p>
Adding video is a two-step process.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Select video file
</li>
<li>Choose import-mode and optionally select an audio-track to extract
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<br/>

</p>


<p>
The first step is rather straight forward: The panel on the right side allows to seek through the video and displays basic file information. It is also useful to check if the video format/codec is supported:
</p>

</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
The second step analyzes the video file in more detail and offers import options:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Import/Transcode to Session</strong>. This is the default. The video will be imported in a suitable video-format/codec for the timeline and video monitor and saved inside the session folder. A location other than the session folder can also be chosen (external disk, network storage of the video server on a different machine…).
</li>
<li><strong>Reference from Current Location</strong>. Only useful for opening files that were previously encoded (are already in a good format/codec) use with care.
</li>
<li><strong>Do not Import Video</strong> - useful for extracting audio only.
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
By default the video is imported using the original width/height.
If it is a large video (e.g. full-HD) it makes sense to scale it down to decrease the CPU load and disk I/O which required to decode and play the file.
A small, low-quality representation of the image is usually sufficient for editing sound-tracks.
The default bitrate in kbit/sec is set to use 0.7 bits per pixel. (compare: the average DVD medium uses 5000kbit/sec; at PAL resolution this is about 0.5 bits per pixel - but the DVD is using the <em>mpeg2</em> - a denser compression algorithm than the <em>mjpeg</em> codec used by Ardour.)
</p>

<h2>Working with A/V</h2>

<p>
Well now,..

</p>


<h2><a id="export" name="export"></a>Exporting Videoi</h2>

<p>
The video-export will take audio from the current Ardour session and multiplex it with a video-file.
</p>

<p>
The soundtrack of the video is taken from an audio-export of Ardour's master bus.
</p>

<p>
The video file can be chosen freely, For high quality exports, the original file (before it was imported in the timeline) should be used. This is also the default if the file can be found, if not Ardour will suggest to use the imported proxy-video which is currently in use on the timeline.  Any existing audio tracks on the video-file are stripped.
</p>

<p>
The range selection allows to cut or extend the video. If the session is longer than the video duration, black frames are prefixed or appended to the video (Note: this process may fail with non-standard pixel-aspect-ratios). If Ardour&#039;s session range is shorter the video will be cut accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Audio-samplerate and normalize-audio are options for Ardour's audio exporter. The remaining settings are options that are directly passed on to ffmpeg.
</p>

<p>
The file-format is determined by the file-extension that you choose for the output file (.avi, .mov, .flv, .ogv, .webm,...)
Note: not all combinations of format+codec+settings produce files which are according so spec. e.g. flv files require sample-rates of 22.1kHz or 44.1kHz, mpeg containers can not be used with ac3 audio-codec, etc. If in doubt, use one of the built-in presets

<p>
Ardour video export is not recommended for mastering!\nWhile 'ffmpeg' (which is used by Ardour) can produce high-quality files, this export lacks the possibility to tweak many settings. We recommend to use 'winff', 'devede' or 'dvdauthor' to mux &amp; master. Nevertheless this video-export comes in handy to do quick snapshots, intermediates, dailies or online videos.
