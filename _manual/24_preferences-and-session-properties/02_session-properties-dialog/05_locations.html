<p>
  These options add file locations that will be searched to find the audio and 
  midi files used by the session. This is useful when the files have been 
  imported into the session but not copied into the session.

<p>
  To add a location, navigate to the directory where the files are stored.  
  Drill down into the directory and then click open.  The directory will
  show up in the dialog.  The remove button next to the added directory can be used
  to remove it from the search path.
