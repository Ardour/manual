<h2>Adding new notes</h2>
<p>
  For light MIDI editing, you can use the Internal Edit Mode. 
  This mode lets you select notes, copy, move or delete them and alter their
  properties (see below). To <em>add</em> notes using the mouse, <kbd class="mouse mod1">Left</kbd>-drag. 
  
  For more extensive MIDI editing, you may prefer <kbd class="menu">Draw Mode</kbd>. 
  You can click or drag to add a new note, without having to hold down Ctrl. However, 
  Draw Mode doesn't offer region-level editing.
</p>

<p>So, to summarize:</p>
<table class="dl">
    <tr><th>Selecting, moving, copying, trimming, deleting <em>regions</em></th>
        <td><kbd class="menu">Note Level Editing</kbd> disabled, using object,
        range or other mouse modes</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Selecting, moving, copying trimming, deleting <em>notes</em></th>
        <td><kbd class="menu">Note Level Editing</kbd> enabled, and using mouse object mode</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Adding new notes</th>
        <td>enabling "Note Level Editing" and then either
          <ul>
            <li>using mouse object mode and <kbd class="mouse mod1">Left</kbd>-drag, or</li>
            <li>using mouse draw mode.</li>
          </ul>
        </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
  Note that there is also <a href="@@step-entry">a step entry editor</a> allowing to
  enter notes from a virtual keyboard and lots more besides.
