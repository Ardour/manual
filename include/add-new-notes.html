<p class=fixme>WTH is &ldquo;Note Level Editing&rdquo;? (See table below, &ldquo;So, to summarize&hellip;&rdquo;.)</p>

<h2>Adding new notes</h2>

<p>
  For light MIDI editing, Internal Edit Mode can be used. This mode allows
  selecting, copying, moving and deleting notes, and also allows altering
  notes&rsquo; properties. To <em>add</em> notes using the mouse, <kbd
  class="mouse mod1">Left</kbd>-drag. For more extensive MIDI editing, <kbd
  class="menu">Draw Mode</kbd> may be preferred. New notes can be added with
  a click or drag, without having to hold down <kbd class=mod1n></kbd>.
  However, <kbd class="menu">Draw Mode</kbd> doesn't allow region-level
  editing.
</p>

<p class=fixme>Not sure if the following paragraph is true.</p>
<p>
  In both modes, a mouse <em>click</em> creates a note at the pointer location
  (or the nearest grid point if grid is enabled), and its duration is one <a
  href="@@grid-controls">Grid unit</a>, even if the grid is disabled. A mouse
  <em>drag</em> creates the note like a click does, but allows continuously
  setting the duration of the note until the mouse button is released.
</p>

<p>So, to summarize:</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr>
    <th>Selecting, moving, copying, trimming, deleting <em>regions</em></th>
    <td><kbd class="menu">Note Level Editing</kbd> disabled, using object, range or other mouse modes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Selecting, moving, copying trimming, deleting <em>notes</em></th>
    <td><kbd class="menu">Note Level Editing</kbd> enabled, and using mouse object mode</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Adding new notes</th>
    <td>Enabling "Note Level Editing" and then either
      <ul>
        <li>using mouse object mode and <kbd class="mouse mod1">Left</kbd>-drag, or</li>
        <li>using mouse draw mode.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>

<p class="note">
  There is also <a href="@@step-entry">a step entry editor</a> that allows the
  entry of notes from a virtual keyboard.
