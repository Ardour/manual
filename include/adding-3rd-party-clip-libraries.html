<p>
	You can add as many sample library locations as you like and easily
	switch between them using the drop-down list at the top of the Clips
	browser.
</p>

<p>
	There are two ways to add new library location. The first one is
	by using the <kbd class="window">Edit Sample Library Path</kbd> window
	directly:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		In the <dfn>Clips</dfn> tab of the sidebar, click the top drop-down list and choose <kbd class="menu">Edit</kbd>.

		<figure class="right">
		  <img src="/images/clips-locations-in-the-dropdown-list.png" width="400px" alt="Clips' locations in the drop-down list">
		  <figcaption>
		    Clips' locations in the drop-down list
		  </figcaption>
		</figure>
	</li>
	<li>
		In the newly opened dialog called
		<kbd class="window">Edit Sample Library Path</kbd> click
		<kbd class="button">Add</kbd> and locate the folder that contains
		samples. If there are subfolders, choose the parent folder that
		contains all of them.
	</li>
	<li>
		Repeat for all other sample libraries.
	</li>
	<li>
		Click <kbd class="button">OK</kbd> to apply changes.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Alternatively, you can drop a folder from a file manager into the list
	of clips in the Clips browser. This will add a new clip library location
	stored across sessions. 
</p>

<p>
	Now when you click the drop-down list at the top of <dfn>Clips</dfn>, you will see all the paths you added.
</p>

<p>
	Should you need to delete any path you previously added, open the
	<kbd class="window">Edit Sample Library Path</kbd> dialog again, select
	the path and click <kbd class="button">Delete</kbd>.
</p>
