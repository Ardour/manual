	You can add as many sample library locations as you like and easily
	switch between them. To do that:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		In the <dfn>Clips</dfn> tab of the sidebar, click the top drop-down list and choose <kbd class="menu">Edit</kbd>.

		<figure class="right">
		  <img src="/images/clips-locations-in-the-dropdown-list.png" alt="Clips' locations in the 		drop-down list">
		  <figcaption>
		    Clips' locations in the drop-down list
		  </figcaption>
		</figure>
	</li>
	<li>
		In the newly opened dialog called <dfn>Edit Sample Library Path</dfn> click <kbd class="button">Add</kbd> and locate the folder that contains samples. If there are subfolders, choose the parent folder that contains them all.
	</li>
	<li>
		Repeat for all other sample libraries.
	</li>
	<li>
		Click <kbd class="button">OK</kbd> to apply changes.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Alternatively, you can drop a folder from a file manager into the list
	of clips in the Clips browser. This will add a new clip library location
	stored across sessions.
</p>

<p>
	Now when you click the drop-down list at the top of <dfn>Clips</dfn>, you will see all the paths you added.
</p>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="/images/clips-locations-in-the-dropdown-list.png" alt="Clips' locations in the drop-down list">
  <figcaption>
    Clips' locations in the drop-down list
  </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
	Should you need to delete any path you previously added, open the <dfn>Edit Sample Library Path</dfn> dialog again, select the path and click <kbd class="button">Delete</kbd>.
