  
<p>
  There are several ways to importing an audio or MIDI file into a 
  session:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Import</kbd></li>
  <li>Region List context menu: <kbd class="menu">Import To Region List</kbd></li>
  <li>Track context menu: <kbd class="menu">Import Existing Media</kbd>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  These methods are all equivalent: they open the <a
  href="/adding-pre-existing-material/import-dialog/">Add Existing Media</a> 
  dialog.  
</p>
<p>
  Finally, you can also easily import files into your project by dragging 
  and dropping a file from some other application (e.g. your platform's 
  file manager). You can drag onto the 
  <dfn>Region List</dfn>, into the desired <dfn>track</dfn> or into empty 
  space in the editor track display.<br />
  The file will be imported and copied 
  into your session, and placed at the position where the drag ended.
