  There are several ways to importing an audio or MIDI file into a session:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Main menu: <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Import</kbd></li>
  <li>Region List context menu: <kbd class="menu">Import To Region List</kbd></li>
  <li>Track context menu: <kbd class="menu">Import Existing Media</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>
  These methods are all equivalent: they open the <a href="@@import-dialog">Add
  Existing Media</a> dialog.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, files can also easily be imported into a project by dragging and
  dropping a file from some other application (e.g. the system's file manager).
  Files can either be dragged onto the <dfn>Region List</dfn>, into the desired
  <dfn>track</dfn> or into an empty space in the editor track display.
</p>
<p>
  The file will be imported and copied into the session, and placed at the
  position where the drag ended.
