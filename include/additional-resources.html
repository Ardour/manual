<p>
  In addition to this documentation, there are a variety of other
  <dfn>resources</dfn>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://ardour.org/whatsnew.html">Ardour release notes</a>
  </li>
  <li>the <a href="https://discourse.ardour.org/">Ardour Forums</a></li>
  <li>information about <a href="https://community.ardour.org/community">Ardour
  Support</a> via mailing lists and IRC (chat)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The <dfn>IRC channels</dfn> in particular are where most of the day-to-day
  development and debugging is done, and there are plenty of experienced users
  to help if problems are encountered when using Ardour.
</p>

<p>
  Please be prepared to hang around for a few hours, the chat is usually
  busiest from 19:00&nbsp;UTC to 04:00&nbsp;UTC. It is best to keep one's IRC
  client window open if possible, so that a belated answer can be seen.
