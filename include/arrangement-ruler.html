	The Arrangement ruler allows creating range sections that separate
	meaningful parts of songs form each other and easily creating their copies.
	An example of using range sections would recording an intro, then the first
	verse, then the chorus, then recording the second verse, the copy/pasting
	the chorus with all tracks and automation to follow the second verse.
</p>

<p>
	On the screenshot below, there's a typical setup with an intro, a verse,
	a chorus, a second verse, a chorus, a bridge, a chorus, and an outro:

<h2 id="creating-range-sections">Creating range sections</h2>

<p>
	To start a new range section, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and single-click on the
	Arrangement ruler. Ardour will create a new range section marker named
	'verseN', where N is a number starting at 1 and incremented each time you
	create a new range section marker.
</p>

<p>
	Because range section assume ranges, a second marker should be created
	the same way to define the end of the range. Thus, as the song ends with
	an 'outro' section, you will need to create the last range section marker
	at the end of the song and give it a name like 'end'.
