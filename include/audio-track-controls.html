</figure>

<p>
  At the top-left of the controls is the name of the track, which can be
  edited by double-clicking on it. The new name must be unique within the
  session.
</p>
<p>
  Underneath the name is the track's main level fader. Changing it will affect
  the whole track :
</p>
<ul>
  <li><kbd class="mouse">dragging</kbd> will change the fader's value as
    per the mouse's position</li>
  <li><kbd class="mod1 mouse">clicking</kbd> will set the fader to &minus;&infin;
    </li>
  <li><kbd class="mod3 mouse">clicking</kbd> will reset the fader to its original
    0dB position.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  On the right-hand side of the headers are level meters for the outputs of the track
  (1 level per output).
</p>

<p>
  The control buttons are:
