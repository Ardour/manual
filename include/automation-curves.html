<p>
  An <dfn>automation curve</dfn> is a series of lines connected by <dfn>control
  points</dfn> that defines a continuous line. As the curve is traversed from
  left to right, the line defines the level of the parameter controlled by the
  automation lane.
</p>

<p>
  The curve by itself does nothing; it will <em>only</em> control playback if
  the lane it is in is in <kbd class=menu>Play</kbd> mode.
