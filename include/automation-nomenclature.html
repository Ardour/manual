<p>
  Track automation occurs in one or more <dfn>lanes</dfn>. Each lane has a
  control that allows setting the amount or position of a certain
  <dfn>parameter</dfn> associated with the lane. Parameters are things that can
  be controlled on a track's automation lane, such as volume, panning, muting,
  trim, etc. <dfn>Automation curves</dfn> consist of lines connected by
  <dfn>control points</dfn>, that live within the confines of a lane; these
  tell Ardour how to change a given parameter over time. <dfn>Automation
	modes</dfn> specify whether the control points are connected by lines or
	stair steps. <dfn>Automation states</dfn> govern how a given automation lane
	will behave during playback.
