  <dfn>Automation</dfn> is the ability to dynamically control various aspects
  of a track's innate attributes and the attributes of any processors attached
  to it. In Ardour, automation can be used to make dynamic changes to a
  track's:

<ul>
  <li>Fader (Volume)</li>
  <li>Trim</li>
  <li>Muting</li>
  <li>Panning</li>
  <li>Any attached processor's parameters</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Any combination of these can be enabled on a single track; as such, it offers
  a lot of power and flexibility over how a track will ultimately sound when
  played back.
</p>

<p>
  Activating automation for a track is done by clicking the <kbd class="menu">A</kbd> icon on the
  <a href="@@audio-track-controls">track head</a> and checking the
  type of automation needed. A new "pseudo-track" will appear, showing the 
  waveform in the background, called an "automation lane", where the value
  of the parameter can be edited : the x axis is the time, and the y axis is
  the value of the parameter.
</p>
<p>
  If the <kbd class="option">Edit &gt; Show Automation Lane on Touch</kbd>
  is checked, clicking any parameter in a plugin window, a hardware controller, etc...
  will result in this parameter's automation lane being temporarily shown, 
  and clicking another parameter will hide this lane to show the new one.
