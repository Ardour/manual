  For stereo tracks, you can now switch between the default stereo panner
  and a traditional <dfn>balance control</dfn> by right-clicking on the
  panner widget.

control"/>

  When the balance is centered, the incoming signals will be unaffected.
  Moving it to one side will linearly attenuate the signal of the opposite
  side.
</p>
<p class="note">
  While the balance control is considerably less flexible than the stereo
  panner, it works with arbitrary content without danger of introducing
  comb filter artefacts.
