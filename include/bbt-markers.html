<p>
  <dfn>BBT markers</dfn> allow resetting the timeline to a particular bar and
  beat. Most of the time a BBT marker will reset it to 1|1|0 (the very first
  beat of the very first bar) so that for each song in a multi-song session
  there would be a musical time origin. However it's entirely possible to reset
  to an arbitrary value such as 7|3|0.

<p>
  To create a new BBT marker, <kbd class="mod1n"></kbd>-click on the
  Bars:Beats ruler. This will open a dialog titled 'New Music Time' where you
  can name the marker and define what bar (left field) and beat (right field)
  this marker should reset the time to.

  The timeline grid and the ruler will be updated accordingly:
