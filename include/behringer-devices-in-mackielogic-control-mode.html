<p>
  The Behringer BCF-2000 Fader Controller is a control surface with 8 motorized
  faders, 8 rotary encoders and 30 push buttons. The device is a class
  compliant USB Midi Interface and also has standard Midi DIN IN/OUT/THRU  ports.
  The device has included a Mackie/Logic Control Emulation Mode since firmware v1.06.
  Any devices with a firmware older than v1.06 will require an update before
  Mackie Control Emulation works as described here.
</p>

<p>
  In order to put the controller into Mackie/Logic control mode, the unit must be
  turned on while holding the third button from the left in the top most row
  of buttons (under the rotary encoder row). The button must be held down until <kbd class="input">EG</kbd>
  or edit global mode is displayed on the LCD screen of the unit. The global parameters
  can then be edited using the 8 rotary encoders in the top row.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
      Encoder #1 sets the operating mode and should be set to <kbd class="input">U-1</kbd> or
      USB mode 1 if using with a USB cable connection.
    </li>
    <li>
      Encoder #3 sets the foot switch mode and should most likely be set to
      <kbd class="input">Auto</kbd> to detect how the foot switch is wired.
    </li>
    <li>
      Encoder #5 sets the device id, if you are using only 1 device the id
      should be set to <kbd class="input">ID 1</kbd>. If you are using multiple BCF/BCR2000 each
      device is required to be set up sequentially and one at a time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Encoder #7 controls the MIDI <dfn>Dead Time</dfn> or the amount of milliseconds
      after a move has been made that the device ignores further changes, this
      should be set to <kbd class="input">100</kbd>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Encoder #8 controls the MIDI message <dfn>Send Interval</dfn> in milliseconds
      and should be set to <kbd class="input">10</kbd>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
  To exit the <kbd class="input">EG</kbd> mode press the <kbd class="button">Exit</kbd> button. The device is now
  ready to use with Ardour.
</p>

<h3>Modes of Operation</h3>

<figure>
  <a href="/images/BCF2000-Modes.png"><img style="max-width:500px;" alt="Digramatic Image of the BCF2000 Control Modes" src="/images/BCF2000-Modes.png"></a>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  The four buttons arranged in a rectangle and located under the Behringer logo
  are the mode selection buttons in Logic Control Emulation Mode,
  currently Ardour has implemented support for two of these modes.
</p>
<p>
The surface can be broken into 8 groups of controls:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The rotary encoders at the top of the device</li>
  <li>The first row of buttons under the encoders</li>
  <li>The second row of buttons under the encoders</li>
  <li>The row of motorized faders<li>
  <li>The group of 4 buttons at the top right that will be
    referred to here as the <dfn>Shift Group</dfn></li>
  <li>The group of 4 buttons under the <dfn>Shift Group</dfn>
    referred to here as the <dfn>Mode Group</dfn></li>
  <li>The group of 2 buttons under the <dfn>Mode Group</dfn>
    referred to here as the <dfn>Select Group</dfn></li>
  <li>The group of 4 buttons under the <dfn>Select Group</dfn>
    referred to here as the <dfn>Transport Group</dfn></li>
</ol>

<h3>Mixer Pan Mode</h3>

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  This is the standard work mode that organizes the control surface to emulate
  a standard mixer layout where controls for each track/bus are arranged vertically.
  The order of the faders is either controlled by the order of the tracks in the
  mixer or can be set manually by the user.
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>Encoders</th>
    <td>Mixer Pans. The red LEDs show the amount of pan left or right</td></tr>
  <tr><th>First Row of Buttons</th>
    <td>Mixer Mutes. The button led lights up if the track is currently muted</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Second Row of Buttons</th>
    <td>Select Active Track/Bus. Currently selected track/bus is indicated by the button led</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Faders</th>
    <td>Mixer Gains</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Shift Group</th>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>The top and bottom left buttons are simply shifts to change the function of other buttons.</li>
        <li>The top right is the <dfn>Fine Control</dfn> button that allows the increment values sent by
        by rotary encoders and faders to be a small value for more precise editing. This button
        can also act as a shift button.</li>
        <li>The bottom right is the <dfn>Global Shift</dfn> button that allows you to change back to the
        standard Mixer Pan view from other views and modes. This button can also act as a shift button.</li>
      </ul>
    </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Mode Group</th>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>The top two buttons functions are not currently implemented in Ardour.</li>
        <li>The bottom left button sets the device to <dfn>Pan</dfn> mode and should currently be lit</li>
        <li>The bottom right button sets the device to <dfn>Send</dfn> mode but will only allow the switch
        if the currently selected track/bus has a send or sends to control.</li>
      </ul>
    </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Select Group</th>
    <td>
    In this mode they function as bank select left and right. If the current session has more than 8 tracks
    the next set of 8 tracks is selected with the right button and the faders will move to match the
    current gain settings of that bank of 8 tracks/busses. If the last bank contains less than 8
    tracks/busses the unused faders will move to the bottom and the pan lights will all turn
    off. An unlimited amount of tracks can be controlled with the device.
    </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Transport Group</th>

<h3>Send Mode</h3>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Send mode allows for the top row of encoders to control the sends for a selected channel.
  One interesting option is to flip the controls from the encoders to the faders by pressing
  the <kbd class="button">shift 1</kbd> button and the <kbd class="button">global view</kbd> button at the same time.
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>Encoders</th>
  <td>
    In send mode, the encoders control sends from left to right instead of mixer pans.
    If there are less than 8 sends the behavior of the encoder will be to continue controlling
    the mixer pan. Visually it is indicated by the change in the LED from originating at the 12
    o'clock position to originating at the 7 o'clock position. If <kbd class="button">FLIP</kbd> is pressed
    the encoder will control the mixer gain for the selected track/bus.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>First row of buttons</th>
  <td>No Change</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Second row of buttons</th>
  <td>No Change.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Faders</th>
  <td>
    No change unless <kbd class="button">FLIP</kbd>is pressed then it controls the send for the selected track/bus.

  <tr><th>Select Group</th>

    These now change the current bank of tracks being controlled over by
    one. So if tracks 1-8 where controlled, pushing the <kbd class="button">right</kbd> button will change the
    controlled tracks to 2-9, and pressing the <kbd class="button">left</kbd> would then shift back to controlling tracks 1-8.

<h2 id="xtouch">Behringer X-Touch</h2>
<p>
  The Behringer X-Touch is a direct emulation of the Mackie Control and has all the
  buttons the Mackie device does. There is a "Behringer X-Touch" map included with
  Ardour. The X-Touch can be connected to the computer with USB or through a MIDI port.
  Using USB keeps MIDI ports free for other uses. The Ethernet port uses RTP MIDI
  which should show up as MIDI devices on MacOS computers.
</p>

<h2 id="compact">Behringer X-Touch Compact</h2>
<p>
 The Behringer X-Touch Compact has a Mackie Control mode. From the device manual:</p>
 <p class="note">"To switch between standard operating mode and MC (Mackie Control) mode, press
 and hold down the MC button in the bottom left  corner, and then turn on
 the unit’s power switch. Keep holding down the MC button until the MC MODE LED
 lights continuously to show that the unit is in MC mode."</p>
<p>
 There is a "Behringer X-Touch Compact" map included with Ardour. The X-Touch can be
 connected to the computer with USB or through a MIDI port. Using USB keeps MIDI ports
 free for other uses.
</p>

<p>
 The Behringer X-Touch Compact has fewer controls than the Mackie control and therefore
 less function as well. See pages 19-21 of the Behringer X-Touch Compact Quick Start Guide
 For an explanation of what controls on the Compact map to which Mackie Control buttons.
</p>
<h2 id="mini">Behringer X-Touch Mini</h2>
<p>
  The Behringer X-Touch Mini says it can emulate Mackie control as well. There is a
  "Behringer X-Touch Mini" map included with Ardour. The control layout in Mackie Control
  mode is shown below.
