<p>
  The <dfn>Big Clock</dfn> is a copy of the main <a 
  href="@@transport-clocks">primary transport clock</a>, in its 
  own window, and is activated by checking <kbd class="option">Window 
  &gt; Big Clock</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
  The window is always on top of other windows (Ardour or others), 
  fully resizable and the clock will always fill the window, making it 
  very useful when working away from the screen but still wanting to 
  see the playhead position clearly (such as when working with a remote 
  control device across a room), or when showing the time on its own 
  screen. 	
</p>

<p>
  Like most other clocks, it can be <kbd 
  class="mouse">right</kbd>-clicked to change its <a 
  href="@@editing-clocks#clock-modes">clock mode</a>. It can also be <a 
  href="@@editing-clocks">edited</a> to transport the playhead to a 
  specific point in time. The big clock will also change its visual 
  appearance to indicate when active recording is taking place, by 
  changing color.
