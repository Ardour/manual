<p>
	The <dfn>Bundle Manager</dfn> simplifies connecting I/O channels in cases
	where similarly purposed instruments/mics are scattered across
	a multi-channel audio interface. A common scenario is recording a drumkit
	with 6 mics. If you need to re-route the mics in the session, instead of
	connecting each and every one of them separately, you can create a bundle
	and connect just the bundle.
</p>
<p>
	Bundles can be created for both sources (e.g. mic inputs) and destinations
	(e.g. studio monitors). You can create as many bundles as you like.

<h2>Creating a bundle</h2>

<p>
	Click <kbd class="menu">New</kbd> button to create a new bundle.
	In the newly opened dialog, give it a name, choose whether you want this
	to be a bundle of source or destination channels, then connect the ports
	that you want to collect to the bundle port.

<p>
	Close the dialog to apply changes.
</p>

<h2>Connecting a bundle</h2>

<p>
	When connecting a bundle to a port, it works as a convenience proxy
	for the physical ports. Clicking to connect a bundle (here, "Guitar 
	tracks in") to an input automatically connects all the actuel ports
	in the bundle at once.

<h2>Editing and deleting bundles</h2>

<p>
	At any time you can re-open the Bundle Manager window, select a bundle,
	click <kbd class="menu">Edit</kbd> and change connection of physical
	ports to the bundle. Close the window to apply changes.
</p>

<p>
	You can easily delete an existing bundle. Open the Bundle Manager window,
	select a bundle, click <kbd class="menu">Delete</kbd>.
</p>

<h2>Reusing bundles</h2>

<p>
	As bundles are part of a session rather than a global setting, you can
	save them as part of a template for further reuse. Simply create a new
	session, create and connect tracks, busses, and bundles, then save your
	session as a template. Choose this template when creating a new session.
