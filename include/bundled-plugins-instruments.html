<h2>General MIDI Synth</h2>

<p>
  This is a convenience plugin for playing standard MIDI files. It uses the
  FluidSynth engine and the GeneralUser GS soundfont by S. Christian Collins.
  The plugin comes with a MIDI map for simple patch selection in the user
  interface. General MIDI Synth was developed outside Ardour and comes bundled
  with it as 3rd party software in the official builds available from Ardour's
  website.
