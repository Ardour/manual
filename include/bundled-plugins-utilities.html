<h2 id="ace-amplifier">ACE Amplifier</h2>

<p>
  This plugin can adjust gain by +/- 20dB anywhere in the processor box.
  It's typically useful in scenarios where a plugin's output needs to be
  adjusted, but the plugin does not provide its output level control.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Gain</em> is the only available setting. It can be set in the generic
  plugin editor dialog or adjusted on the respective automation lane.

<h2 id="ace-mute">ACE Mute</h2>

<p>
  This plugin can mute the signal anywhere in the processing chain as opposed
  to automating the mute state of the track that works on all processed audio
  only. Using <em>ACE Mute</em> in the very beginning of the signal chain means
  that in the muted state no signal is processed by plugins further in the
  processing chain.
</p>

<p>
  <em>ACE Mute</em> has no settings. All user interaction happens
  in the dedicated automation lane:

<p>
  Ardour also ships with a variation of <em>ACE Mute</em> called
  <em>ACE Slow Mute</em> that applies a 1 second long fade out/in before/after
  the muting.

<h2 id="voice-level-activate">Voice/Level Activate</h2>

<p>
  This plugin rolls the transport when the signal level on the plugin's input
  exceeds a user-defined level. A common scenario where this is helpful is
  recording in a home studio where an instrument or a vocal mic is at a distance
  from the computer. Arming a track for recording, toggling recording mode, then
  clapping in front of a mic or plucking a string will roll the transport and
  start recording to a track of choice.

  The only configurable setting is the input level threshold.
