<h2 id="ace-amplifier">ACE Amplifier</h2>

<p>
  This plugin can adjust gain by +/- 20dB anywhere in the processor box.
  It's typically useful in scenarios where a plugin's output needs to be
  adjusted, but the plugin does not provide its output level control.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Gain</em> is the only available setting. It can be set in the generic
  plugin editor dialog or adjusted on the respective automation lane.
</p>

<h2 id="ace-a-b-switch">ACE A/B Switch</h2>

<p>
  This plugin allows switching between two plugins earlier in the processing
  chain using an automation lane and custom pin connections.
</p>
<p>
  In the example below, the processor box has two ACE Delay plugins processing
  input differently. Each plugin has two manually added outputs so that the
  original signal would flow into one instance of a plugin while bypassing the
  other one. All four resulting outputs then flow into the ACE A/B Switch
  plugin. Inputs 1 and 3 are combined into the A version of the stereo mix,
  inputs 2 and 4 are combined into the B version of a stereo mix.
</p>

<p>
  ACE A/B Switch will default to the A output. Using an automation lane, it's
  possible to momentarily switch to the B output and back.

<p>
  The plugin supports 1-, 2-, and 4-channel configurations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Mono out: In 1/2 -&gt; Out 1</li>
<li>Stereo out: In 1/3 -&gt; Out 1, In 2/4 -&gt; Out 2</li>
<li>Quad out: In 1/5 -&gt; Out 1, In 2/6 -&gt; Out 2, In 3/7 -&gt; Out 3, In 4/8 -&gt; Out 4</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ace-cross-fade">ACE Cross Fade</h2>

<p>Automatable Crossfade. Channels are grouped:
Mono out:  In 1/2 -&gt; Out 1
Stereo out: In 1/3 -&gt; Out 1, In 2/4 -&gt; Out 2
Quad out: In 1/5 -&gt; Out 1, In 2/6 -&gt; Out 2, In 3/7 -&gt; Out 3, In 4/8 -&gt; Out 4</p> -->

<h2 id="ace-mute">ACE Mute</h2>

<p>
  This plugin can mute the signal anywhere in the processing chain as opposed
  to automating the mute state of the track that works on all processed audio
  only. Using <em>ACE Mute</em> in the very beginning of the signal chain means
  that in the muted state no signal is processed by plugins further in the
  processing chain.
</p>

<p>
  <em>ACE Mute</em> has no settings. All user interaction happens
  in the dedicated automation lane:

<p>
  Ardour also ships with a variation of <em>ACE Mute</em> called
  <em>ACE Slow Mute</em> that applies a 1 second long fade out/in before/after
  the muting.
</p>

<h2 id="voice-level-activate">Voice/Level Activate</h2>

<p>
  This plugin rolls the transport when the signal level on the plugin's input
  exceeds a user-defined level. A common scenario where this is helpful is
  recording in a home studio where an instrument or a vocal mic is at a distance
  from the computer. Arming a track for recording, toggling recording mode, then
  clapping in front of a mic or plucking a string will roll the transport and
  start recording to a track of choice.

<p>
  The only configurable setting is the input level threshold.
</p>

<h2 id="midi-note-mapper">MIDI Note Mapper</h2>

<p>
  Maps arbitrary MIDI notes to others. This affects both note-on and note-off
  events, as well as polyphonic key pressure. A single note can be mapped
  twice, but only the last mapping is used.
