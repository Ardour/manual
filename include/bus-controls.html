<p>
  The bus' header is very similar to the <a href="@@audio-track-controls">audio track
  header</a>, minus :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the playlist button, as a bus doesn't have any playlists or regions by itself,
  it is only a pipe to route audio or midi through</li>
  <li>the record button, for the same reason.</li>
</ul>
