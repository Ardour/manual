  All details about selected notes can be viewed by context-clicking on them. The dialog that pops up also allows for the modification of all properties of the selected notes. Individual properties can also be modified more efficiently using the techniques described below:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>Moving notes</th>
  <td>
    <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> move selected notes earlier and later in time.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Changing pitch values</th>
  <td>
    <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> raises the pitch of the selected notes.<br>
    <kbd>&darr;</kbd> lowers the pitch of the selected notes.<br>
    If any of the selected notes are already at their minimum or maximum values,
    no changes will be made to any them, to preserve their relative pitches.
    This can be overridden with <kbd class="mod2"> </kbd>. The default shift
    distance is one semitone. <kbd class="mod3"> </kbd> alters this to
    one octave.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Changing velocity values</th>
  <td>
    <kbd class="mod1">&uarr;</kbd> increases the velocity of the selected notes.
    <br/>
    <kbd class="mod1">&darr;</kbd> reduces the velocity of the selected
    notes.<br>
    If any of the selected notes are already at their minimum or maximum values,
    no changes will be made to them, to preserve their relative velocities. This can be overridden with <kbd class="mod2"> </kbd>.
    Also, pressing <kbd>v</kbd> pops up a dialog that allows setting
    the absolute velocity value of all selected notes. Finally, the scroll wheel
    <kbd class="mouse">&uArr;</kbd> <kbd class="mouse">&dArr;</kbd> will also
    adjust notes in the same way as the arrow keys (note that, like the arrow keys,
    it only affects selected notes&mdash;not the note the pointer is over).
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Changing channel</th>
  <td>
    Pressing <kbd>c</kbd> brings up a dialog that allows viewing and/or altering the
    MIDI channel of the selected notes. If the selected notes use different
    channels, they will all be forced to the newly selected channel.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Changing start/end/duration</th>
  <td>
    <kbd>,</kbd> (comma) will alter the start time of the note.<br>
    <kbd>.</kbd> (period) will alter the end time of the note. Both keys will by
    default make the note longer (either by moving the start earlier or the end
    later). For the opposite effect, <kbd class="mod1">,</kbd>/<kbd
    class="mod1">.</kbd> can be used. The note will be altered by the current grid setting.
    To change the start/end positions by 1/128th of a beat, the <kbd
    class="mod2"> </kbd> modifier must be added to these shortcuts.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Quantization</th>
  <td>
    <kbd>q</kbd> will quantize the selected notes using the current quantize
    settings. If the quantize settings have not been set for this session yet,
    the quantize dialog will appear. <kbd class="mod2">q</kbd> will display the
    quantize dialog to allow editing the current quantize settings, and then
    will quantize the selected notes. The default quantize settings are: quantize
    note starts to the current grid setting, no swing, no threshold, full
    strength.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Step Entry, Quantize, etc.</th>
    <td>Refer to the <a href="@@step-entry">Step Entry</a>, <a
    href="@@quantize-midi">Quantizing MIDI</a>, etc. specific pages.</td></tr>
