  
<p>Recording and editing any serious session might leave the session with some
  unused or misplaced files here and there. Ardour can help deal with this clutter thanks
  to the tools located in the <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Clean-up</kbd> menu.
</p>

<h2 id="bring_all_media_into_session_folder">Bring all media into session folder</h2>

<p>When <a href="/adding-pre-existing-material/">importing media files</a>, if
  the <kbd class="option">Copy files to session</kbd> hasn't been checked, Ardour uses
  the source file from its original destination, which can help avoiding file duplication.
  Nevertheless, when the session needs to be archived or transfered to another computer, moving
  the session folder won't move those <em>external</em> files as they are not in the folder, as seen
  in <a href="/working-with-sessions/backup-and-sharing-of-sessions/">Backup and sharing of sessions</a>.
</p>

<p>Using the <kbd class="menu">Bring all media into session folder</kbd> menu ensures
  that all media files used in the session are located inside the session's folder, hence avoiding
  any missing files when copied.
</p>
  
<h2 id="reset_peak_files">Reset Peak Files</h2>

<p>Ardour represents audio waveforms with peak files, that are graphical images generated from the
  sound files. This generation can be time and CPU consuming, so it uses a cache of the generated
  images to speed up the display process. To watch for files modification, Ardour relies on the file-modification 
  time. If an external file is embedded in the session and that file changes, but the system-clock is skewed 
  or it is stored on an external USB disk (VFAT), Ardour can't know the change happend, and will still use its 
  deprecated peak files.
</p>

<p>Using the <kbd class="menu">Reset Peak Files</kbd> menu allows to reset this cache, which frees up disk space,
  and forces the re-creation of the peak files used in the session. It can prove useful if some waveforms 
  are not used anymore, or if a graphical or time glitch happens.
</p>

<h2 id="clean_up_unused_sources">Clean-up Unused Sources...</h2>

<p>Recording usually lefts a lot of unused takes behind, be it in midi or audio form, that can clutter
  the Region List, and eat up a lot of hard drive space. While its generally a good practice to keep as
  many things as possible while recording, when transferring or archiving the session, some clean up can
  help a lot in reducing the sessions clutter and size.
<p>

<p>Selecting <kbd class="menu">Clean-up Unused Sources...</kbd> will force Ardour to detect those unused waveforms
  by looking for unused regions, and (through a prompt) for unused playlists. The media files won't be destroyed, though.
  At this stage, they are just copied in a particular place of the session path (namely, in the <code>dead sounds/</code>
  sub-folder).
</p>

<h2 id="flush_wastebasket">Flush Wastebasket</h2>

<p>Although Ardour is a <em>non-destructive</em> audio-editor, it allows for a very careful destruction of unused media materials.
  This function is closely linked to the previous one. When the unused sources have been cleaned up and quarantined, the 
  <kbd class="menu">Flush Wastebasket</kbd> menu will allow for their physical destruction.
</p>

<p>As a safeguarding mechanism though, Flushing the wastebasket in impossible in the same working session as the Cleaning up of unused sources :
  the user needs to close the session and reload it before flushing. It allows to test the playback of the session and ensure both that Ardour didn't commit
  any mistake (unlikely, but better safe than sorry), and that the user is absolutely sure of what he does.
</p>

<p class="warning">Notice that all media destroyed this way is not sent to the system's <em>trash can</em> but permanently deleted. 
  If a file is mistakenly destroyed this way, the user will have to rely on data recovery techniques to try getting it back.
</p>
