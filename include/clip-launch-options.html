<h2>Velocity Sense</h2>

<p>
  This control defines how much the velocity coming off your MIDI device
  affects clip's volume. At 0%, which is the default, it doesn't matter how
  hard you press a key or a pad, the volume will be what you set it to.
  At 100%, hitting a key as hard as you can produces maximum volume, and
  pressing the key or a pad really softly produces a barely audible sound.
</p>

<h2>Launch Style</h2>

<p>
  The <dfn>Launch Style</dfn> defines how you interact with the clip's
  playback. Ardour makes a distinction between pressing a button or a key
  (the 'down' event for a mouse or the note-on MIDI event) and releasing
  a button or a key (the 'up' event for a mouse or the note-off MIDI event).
</p>

<p>
  You can setup a trigger slot so that you would press a silicon pad on your
  external grid controller, and Ardour would play the clip in that slot
  indefinitely on repeat. Or you could set it up so that it would only repeat
  that clip as long as you are keeping the pad pressed and stop playing it
  as soon as you stop pressing the pad.

<h2>Launch Quantize</h2>

<p>
  This setting defines how long Ardour will wait till beginning the playback
  of a clip in a trigger slot. If the transport is already rolling, and
  quantization is set to 1 bar, which is the default, Ardour will wait for the
  next bar, then start playing the clip. Quantizing to a whole bar or several
  bars typically guarantees that downbeats of a drums track and a bassline
  track align.
</p>

<p>
  The quantization value can be as large as 4 bars and as small as 1/64 bar.
  When 'None' is selected, playback with a rolling transport will start
  immediately.
</p>

<h2>Legato</h2>

<p>
  The <dfn>Legato</dfn> mode helps keeping two clips of the same track in sync
  when you switch from one to another. With Legato on, Ardour will pick up
  the playback of the second clip at the position where the first one left off.
  Please note that quantization applies here.
</p>

<h2>Cue Isolate</h2>

<p>
  When you play the entire cue, all slots that belong to it get triggered.
  <dfn>Solo Isolate</dfn> is a way to disable that for selected slots.
  An isolated slot will only be triggered when you send either mouse-down
  or note-on event directly to it.
