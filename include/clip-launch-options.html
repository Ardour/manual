<h2>Velocity Sense</h2>

<p>
  This control defines how much the velocity coming off your MIDI device
  affects clip's volume. At 0%, which is the default, it doesn't matter how
  hard you press a key or a pad, the volume will be what you set it to.
  At 100%, hitting a key as hard as you can produces maximum volume, and
  pressing the key or a pad really softly produces a barely audible sound.

<h2>Launch Style</h2>

<p>FIXME THE ENTIRE TABLE</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th><kbd class="menu">Trigger</kbd></th>
  <td>You click and it starts playing until it stops; mouse up and note-off are ignored</td></tr>
  <tr><th><kbd class="menu">Retrigger</kbd></th>
  <td>Mouse down or note-on starts or retriggers; mouse up and note-off FIXME</td></tr>
  <tr><th><kbd class="menu">Gate</kbd></th>
  <td>plays only as long as you press the play button, quantization setting defines how soon it starts and ends after pressing the button down. Runs till mouse up/note off then to next quantization</td></tr>
  <tr><th><kbd class="menu">Toggle</kbd></th>
  <td>Keeps looping until you click it again. runs till next mouse down/NoteOn</td></tr>
  <tr><th><kbd class="menu">Repeat</kbd></th>
  <td>Keeps looping, but when you press and hold, it starts from the beginning and plays as far as quantization setting goes, e.g. 1/16 means it repeats the first 1/16 of a bar. plays only quantization extent until mouse up/note off</td></tr>
