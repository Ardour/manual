<h2>Velocity Sense</h2>

<p>
  This control defines how much the velocity coming off your MIDI device
  affects clip's volume. At 0%, which is the default, it doesn't matter how
  hard you press a key or a pad, the volume will be what you set it to.
  At 100%, hitting a key as hard as you can produces maximum volume, and
  pressing the key or a pad really softly produces a barely audible sound.

    <td>Keeps looping, but when you press and hold, it starts from the beginning and plays as far as quantization setting goes, e.g. 1/16 means it repeats the first 1/16 of a bar. plays only quantization extent until mouse up/note off</td></tr>

<h2>Launch Quantize</h2>

<p>From 4 bars down to 1/64 bar, and None. FIXME</p>

<h2>Legato</h2>

<p>FIXME (also, doesn't work properly yet).</p>

<h2>Cue Isolate</h2>

<p>FIXME, If selected, the slot will not respond to start/stop cue events (does it work?)</p>
