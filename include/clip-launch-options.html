<h2>Velocity Sense</h2>

<p>
  This control defines how much the velocity coming off a MIDI device
  affects clip's volume. At 0%, which is the default, it doesn't matter how
  hard a key or a pad is pressed, the volume will be what it is set to.
  At 100%, hitting a key as hard as possible produces maximum volume, and
  pressing the key or a pad really softly produces a barely audible sound.
</p>

<h2>Launch Style</h2>

<p>
  The <dfn>Launch Style</dfn> defines how the user interacts with the clip's
  playback. Ardour makes a distinction between pressing a button or a key
  (the 'down' event for a mouse or the note-on MIDI event) and releasing
  a button or a key (the 'up' event for a mouse or the note-off MIDI event).
</p>

<p>
  A trigger slot can be set up so that pressing a silicon pad on an
  external grid controller, would make Ardour play the clip in that slot
  indefinitely on repeat. Or it could be set up so that Ardour would only repeat
  that clip as long as the pad is kept pressed and stop playing it
  as soon as the pad is released.

<h2>Launch Quantize</h2>

<p>
  This setting defines how long Ardour will wait till beginning the playback
  of a clip in a trigger slot. If the transport is already rolling, and
  quantization is set to 1 bar, which is the default, Ardour will wait for the
  next bar, then start playing the clip. Quantizing to a whole bar or several
  bars typically guarantees that downbeats of a drums track and a bassline
  track align.
</p>

<p>
  The quantization value can be as large as 4 bars and as small as 1/64 bar.
  When 'None' is selected, playback with a rolling transport will start
  immediately.
</p>

<h2>Legato</h2>

<p>
  The <dfn>Legato</dfn> mode helps keeping two clips of the same track in sync
  when switching from one to another. With Legato on, Ardour will pick up
  the playback of the second clip at the position where the first one left off.
  Please note that quantization applies here.
</p>

<h2>Cue Isolate</h2>

<p>
  When an entire cue is played, all slots that belong to it get triggered.
  <dfn>Solo Isolate</dfn> is a way to disable that for selected slots.
  An isolated slot will only be triggered when either mouse-down or note-on
  event is sent directly to it.
</p>

<p>
  Isolated slots are visually separated from others: they have a linear
  black-to-transparent gradient fill in the background of the trigger button.

<p>
  On the screenshot above, the Bass, Lead Synth and El Piano tracks all have
  at least one isolated trigger slot.
