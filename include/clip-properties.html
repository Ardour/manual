<p>
	The contents of this options box partially depends on the type of data
	in the clip, audio or MIDI. The common settings are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<dfn>Name</dfn>: the full name of the clip's file, usually
		visible in its shortened form.
	</li>
	<li>
		<dfn>Load</dfn>: this button allows loading a clip's file into
		the selected trigger slot.
	</li>
	<li>
		<dfn>Color</dfn>: opens up a color chooser dialog to set
		the color of the clip's title inside the trigger slot.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The only audio-specific setting is <dfn>Gain (dB)</dfn> which adjusts
	the output volume of a clip.
</p>

<p>
	For MIDI clips, there are several specific options:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<dfn>Velocity Adj</dfn>: this effectively adjusts the output volume
		by increasing the velocity of MIDI notes.
	</li>
	<li>
		<dfn>Send Patches</dfn>: this enables sending a control message
		to load a particular patch. This is typically used for external
		MIDI gear such a hardware synthesizers.
	</li>
	<li>
		<dfn>MIDI Patches</dfn>: clicking this button will open a dialog
		where a patch can be selected to send when a MIDI clip is triggered.
	</li>
</ul>
