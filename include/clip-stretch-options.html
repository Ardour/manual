<h2>Stretching</h2>

<p>
	When loading an audio clip into a trigger slot, Ardour applies some
	heuristics to estimate its tempo in beats per minute. Unless a metadata
	in the file source provides information,
	<a href="https://github.com/breakfastquay/minibpm">minibpm</a> is used
	to analyze and detect the file's BPM.
</p>

<p>
	After tempo is estimated, the clip is time-stretched to match the
	session's tempo map. This means that should session's tempo change over
	time (in either ramped or constant mode), all audio clips will be
	re-stretched to accommodate for that.
</p>

<p>
	Disabling stretching when original clip's tempo doesn't match that of the
	session will most of the times make the clip audibly go out of sync with
	the beat.
</p>

<h2>Stretch modes</h2>

<p>
	Once stretching is enabled, there are several options how to apply it:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><dfn>Crisp</dfn> works best for sounds with fast onset like drums and percussion</li>
  <li><dfn>Smooth</dfn> is best used for sustained notes like pads</li>
  <li><dfn>Mixed</dfn> is for anything in between</li>
</ul>

<h2>BPM</h2>

<p>
	This is where the estimated tempo is displayed. It can also
	be progressively divided or multiplied by two.
</p>

<p>
	Supposing session's tempo is currently 120bpm and original clip's tempo
	is 90bpm, stretching the clip to match session's tempo will make it sound
	faster that it originally is.
</p>

<p>
	If the estimated clip's tempo is divided by 2, stretching the resulted
	45bpm back to 120bpm will make the clip sound faster. Vice versa,
	multiplying the original clip's tempo by 2 and then stretching it down
	from 180bpm to 120bpm will make the clip sound slower than it originally is.
</p>

<h2>Clip Length</h2>

<p>
	This control allows adjusting the estimated tempo in a finer manner,
	by changing the amount of beats it takes to play the clip in the selected
	trigger slot. The change is immediately displayed in the BPM field above.
</p>

<h2>Length in Bars</h2>

<p>
	This is an estimate of the clip's length as measured in bars for two
	popular time signatures: 4/4 and 3/4.
