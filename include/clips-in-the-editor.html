<p>
	There are two main uses for the Clips browser in the Editor window:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Reusing existing clips</li>
	<li>Creating new clips from content in the timeline</li>
</ol>

<h2>Reusing existing clips</h2>

<p>
	You have two options how to reuse a clip in the Editor.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Add to an existing track. Dragging and dropping a clip from the browser
		on an existing track will add this clip to a location on the timeline
		where you released the mouse button, snapping options apply. Audio clips
		can only be placed on audio tracks, MIDI clips can only be placed on MIDI
		tracks. Additionally, placing a single-channel (mono) clip
		on a multi-channel track will create a clip where only one channel
		is filled with the content of the original clip, the rest of the channels will be silent.
	</li>
	<li>
		Create a new track. Dragging and dropping a clip below the bottom track
		will create a new track from the clip and name it after the clip's file name.
		Ardour will make a few judgements based on clip properties: the track will
		contain as many channels as the audio file has. And for a MIDI clip, Ardour
		will automatically add the "preview" virtual instrument of choice
		to the processor box.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Creating new clips</h2>

<p>
	You can create new clips for further reuse in the Editor window. Please see
	the <a href="@@managing-custom-clips">Managing Custom Clips</a> page
	for more detail.
