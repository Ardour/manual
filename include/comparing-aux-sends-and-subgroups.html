  Auxes and Subgroups share a common concept&mdash;they both provide a way
  for one or more tracks (or busses) to send their signal to a single bus so
  that common signal processing can be applied to the mix of their signals.
</p>
<p>
  <dfn>Aux sends</dfn> leave the existing signal routing to the main mix in place,
  and are typically used to create a separate mix to send to (for example)
  monitors or headphones (for performer monitor mixes):

  <dfn>Subgroups</dfn> usually remove the original signal routing to the main mix and
  replace it with a new one that delivers the output of the subgroup bus to
  the main mix instead.
