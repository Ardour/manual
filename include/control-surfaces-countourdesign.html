<h2>Connecting the Contour Design Shuttle</h2>

<p>
	Plug the USB cable from the shuttle into a USB2 or USB3 port on your computer.
	The device will be automatically recognized by your operating system and will
	appear in any of the lists of possible MIDI ports in Ardour.
</p>

<p>
  To connect the shuttle to Ardour, open the
  <kbd class="window">Preferences</kbd> dialog, and then click
  <kbd>Control Surfaces</kbd>. Tick the <kbd class="option">Enable</kbd> checkbox
  opposite to "Contour Design" to activate Ardour's Contour Design shuttles
  support.
</p>

<p>
  Once the device is activated, click <kbd>Show Protocol Settings</kbd> and in
  the newly opened window configure the device.
</p>

<h2>Contour Design Configuration</h2>

<p>
	The configuration dialog allows setting up various settings for supported
	models of Contour Design shuttles:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Transport speeds for shuttle positions
	</li>
	<li>
		Jump distance for jog wheel (in seconds, beats, or bars)
	</li>
	<li>
		Actions in Ardour for available on-device buttons
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Ardour ships with some sensible defaults for shuttle buttons.
