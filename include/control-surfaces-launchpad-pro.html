<p>
  Since version 8.0, Ardour has had extensive support for the Novation
  Launchpad Pro Mk3, a relatively inexpensive grid/pad controller that
  unlike some similar has its own internal capabilities in addition to
  those provided by DAW interactions. 
</p>

<h2>Connecting the Launchpad Pro</h2>
<p>
  Plug the USB cable from the Launchpad Pro into a USB2 or USB3 port on your
  computer. 
</p>
<p>
  The Launchpad Pro will be automatically recognized by your operating
  system, and will appear in any of the lists of possible MIDI ports
  in both Ardour and other similar software.
</p>
<p>
  Normally, Ardour should be able to automatically detect a connected
  Launchpad Pro device. If it fails, open the Preferences dialog, and
  then click on "Control Surfaces". Click on the "Enable" button in
  the line that says "Launchpad Pro" in order to activate Ardour's
  Launchpad Pro support.
</p>
<p>
  Once you select the input and output port, Ardour will initialize
  the Launchpad Pro and it will be ready to use. You only need do this
  once: once these ports are connected and your session has been
  saved, the connections will be made automatically in this and other
  future sessions.
