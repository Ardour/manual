	The control surface comes with a number of predefined mappings
	that are typically done either with a MIDI map or with MIDI Learn:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Track selection</strong>: you can press left-pointing
		and right-pointing buttons to select the previous or the next
		track.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Basic transport controls</strong>: rolling, stopping,
		toggling rec-mode.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Workflow buttons</strong>: Undo/Redo (Shift+Undo),
		Quantize, Metronome toggle. <em>Note</em>: Capture MIDI is not
		a function available in Ardour, thus unsupported.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Faders</strong>: 8 faders are mapped to the first 8 tracks,
		1 fader is mapped either to the monitor (if the monitor section exists)
		or the master bus (if there is no monitor section).
	</li>
</ul>
