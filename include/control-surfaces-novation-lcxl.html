<h2>Behavior and Configuration</h2>

<p>
	The Launch Control XL was designed for use with Ableton Live, so it has a Mix
	mode for controlling the mixer and a Device mode for controlling various
	devices. Therefore, For Ardour, only a subset of features is available out of
	the box. The vast majority of supported features are not configurable, the
	user interface exposes only one setting: making the 8th fader control the
	master bus. 
</p>

<p>
	Features supported out of the box are:
