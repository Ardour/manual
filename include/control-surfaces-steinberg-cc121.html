<h2>Connecting the CC121</h2>

<p>
	Plug the USB cable from the CC121 into a USB2 or USB3 port on your computer.
	The device will be automatically recognized by your operating system and will
	appear in any of the lists of possible MIDI ports in Ardour.
</p>

<p>
	To connect the CC121 to Ardour, open the <kbd class="window">Preferences</kbd>
	dialog, and then click <kbd>Control Surfaces</kbd>. Tick the
	<kbd class="option">Enable</kbd> checkbox opposite to "Steinberg CC121" to
	activate Ardour's CC121 support.
</p>

<p>
	Once the device is activated, click <kbd>Show Protocol Settings</kbd> and in
	the newly opened window select the device in the drop-down lists for incoming
	and outgoing MIDI events.
</p>

<p>
	Once you select the input and output port, the CC121 will be ready to use.
	You only need do this once: once these ports are connected and your session
	has been saved, the connections will be made automatically in this and other
	future sessions.
</p>

<h2>CC121 Configuration</h2>

<p>
	Ardour supports a subset of features available in the CC121. Various actions
	in the program can be mapped to the following buttons and encoders on the
	device:
