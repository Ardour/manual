<p>
  The WebSockets Server is an experimental control surface that allows
  controlling a running Ardour session via a web browser on any computer
  in the same local network.
</p>

<p>
	The connection between the WebSockets server and a running instance of Ardour
	is two-way: any changes made in the web-based surface are immediately
	available in Ardour, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
  The experimental status means that this control surface is not
  feature-complete and might have bugs.
</p>

<p>
  Supported features are currently limited to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adjusting positions of channel faders and panners in tracks and the master
  bus, as well as muting and unmuting tracks.</li>
  <li>Changing settings of LV2 plugins that have already been loaded into
  tracks or the master bus.</li>
  <li>Rolling or pausing transport.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enabling and Accessing the WebSockets Server</h2>

<p>
  To enable the WebSockets Server surface, open the <em>Preferences</em> dialog
  and go to the <em>Control Surfaces</em> page. Click on the <em>Web Sockets
  Server (Experimental)</em> to enable it. This will immediately run the server
  and make it available on port 3818. You can verify that it's running by
  opening a web browser on the same computer and visiting
  <a href="http://localhost:3818/">http://localhost:3818/</a>. You should see
  the home page that looks like this:

<p>
  To access the server from any device in the same network you need to know the
  broadcast IP address or the hostname of the computer running Ardour. To do
  that, open <kbd class="menu">Window &gt; Log</kbd> right after enabling the
  control surface and look at the message that says something like this:
</p>

<p>
  <code>
  2025-02-28T21:42:14 [INFO]: ArdourWebsockets: listening on: http://fedora:3818/
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  Alternatively, you can use system's specific tools to discover the IP address.
  Once you know the address or the hostname, you can open the control surface
  web app in a browser by visiting the IP address with appended port number.
  E.g. if the IP address of the computer running Ardour is <tt>192.168.1.68</tt>,
  the entire URL will be <tt>http://192.168.1.68:3818/</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Using the WebSockets Server control surface</h2>

<p>
	Various features available in the control surface are spread across three
	pages: <em>Mixer</em>, <em>Transport</em>, and <em>Protocol</em>.</p>

<h3>Mixer</h3>

<p>
	This is where you can view VU meters for each track and the master bus, as
	well as make a number of adjustments:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Change positions of faders and panners.</li>
	<li>Enable and disable the <em>Mute</em> status.</li>
	<li>Adjust settings of LV2 plugins loaded into mixer channels.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The control surface only supports changing settings for LV2 plugins presently.
	LADSPA, VST2/VST3, and AU plugins will not be listed. When an LV2 plugin has
	been loaded into a mixer channel, a button with "f" caption appears on top of
	the mixer channel. Clicking it opens this kind of an overlay:

<h3>Transport</h3>

<p>
	The <em>Transport</em> view displays the timecode of the current playhead
	position and allows toggling playback.

<p>
	The <em>Record</em> toggle is currently non-functional.
</p>

<h3>Protocol</h3>

<p>
	This page is targeted at developers willing to enhance the WebSockets Server
	control surface. It displays the data passed between Ardour and the web
	browser.
