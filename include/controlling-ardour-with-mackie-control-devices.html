  Since Mackie and Logic made the first Logic Control Surface, Mackie
  and other surface manufactures have been making control surfaces that
  use the same protocol to communicate with a DAW. Ardour supports the
  <abbr title="Mackie Control Protocol"><dfn>MCP</dfn></abbr> and will
  work with all these control surfaces.
