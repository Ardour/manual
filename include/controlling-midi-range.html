  The visible note range in a MIDI track can be controlled in two
  principle ways: the note scroomer, or the scroll wheel of your
  mouse.

<p>
  The scroomer offers two kinds of control. You can "grab" it in the
  middle and move it up or down - this adjusts the absolute note range
  displayed up or down. Alternatively you can "grab" the top or bottom
  handle of the scroomer, and move that up or down - this adjusts the
  extent of the note range displayed.

<p>
  Several scroll operations can be used to control the visible note
  range:
  <li>In internal edit mode, with no notes selected, unmodified
    scrolling will move the visible range up and down.</li>
  <li><kbd class="mod1">scroll</kbd> will increase and decrease the
    visible range (zoom out and in)</li>
  <li><kbd class="mod13">scroll</kbd> will expand either the top or
    bottom of the visible note range (depending on scroll
    direction). Think of this as "show me higher pitches" or "show me
    lower pitches".
