<p>
  The <dfn>playhead</dfn> is a red vertical line that indicates the current
  position of playback.
</p>

<h2>Positioning the Playhead</h2>

<h3>Positioning the playhead at the current pointer position</h3>
<p>
  Pressing <kbd>P</kbd> will set the playhead to the current position of
  the mouse pointer, if it is within the editor track area.
</p>

<h3>Positioning the playhead on the timeline</h3>
<p>
  A <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd> click anywhere on the <a href="@@ruler">Ruler</a>
  will move the playhead to that position.
</p>

<h3>Positioning the playhead with the transport clocks</h3>
<p>
  Clicking on either the primary or secondary transport clock and
  <a href="@@editing-clocks">editing their value</a> moves the playhead to a
  specific position.
</p>

<h3>Positioning the playhead at a marker</h3>
<p>
  <kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd> clicking on the marker and selecting either
  <kbd class="menu">Locate to Here</kbd> or <kbd class="menu">Play from
  Here</kbd> will place the playhead at the marker's position.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, placing the mouse pointer on the marker and pressing
  <kbd>P</kbd> sets the playhead precisely on the marker location.
</p>


<h2>Looping the Transport</h2>

<p>
  When the <a href="@@the-loop-range">loop transport</a> button is pressed, the
  playhead will jump the start of the loop range, and continue to the end of that
  range before returning to the start and repeating.
</p>
<p>
  While looping, a light green area is displayed in the Ruler over the tracks to
  show the loop range.
</p>
<p>
  By default, looping is bound to the <kbd>l</kbd> key.
</p>
