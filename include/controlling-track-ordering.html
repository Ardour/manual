<p>
  Ardour does not impose any particular ordering of tracks and busses in
  either the editor or mixer windows. The default arrangements are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  In the <dfn>Editor</dfn> window, the Master bus will always be on top unless
  hidden. Tracks and busses will appear in their initial order, from top to
  bottom. The monitor section (if used) is never visible in the editor window.
  </li>

  <li>
  In the <dfn>Mixer</dfn> window, the tracks and busses will be displayed in
  their initial order, from left to right. The Master bus is always on the far
  right and occupies its own pane, so that it is always visible no matter how
  many other mixer strips are present. If a Monitor section is used, it shows
  up at the right edge of the mixer window; it can also be torn off into a
  separate window.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Reordering Tracks</h2>

<p>
  The <dfn>track ordering</dfn> of the Editor and Mixer is
  <dfn>synchronized</dfn>: if a track is reordered in one window, the ordering
  in the other window will follow.
</p>

<h3>Reordering in the Editor Window</h3>

<p>
  There are three ways to reorder tracks/busses in the Editor window:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Selecting the tracks to be moved, then dragging them up or down with the mouse (available since Ardour 8.7).</li>
  <li>Selecting the tracks to be moved, then using <kbd class="menu">Track &gt; Move Selected Tracks Up</kbd> (shortcut:
  <kbd class="mod1">&uarr;</kbd>) or <kbd class="menu">Track &gt; Move Selected
  Tracks Down</kbd> (shortcut: <kbd class="mod1">&darr;</kbd>).</li>
  <li>Selecting the tracks to be moved in the <a href="@@the-tracks-and-busses-list"><kbd
  class="menu">Tracks &amp; Busses</kbd> panel of the Editor Lists</a> dock, then dragging them up or down.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Reordering in the Mixer Window</h3>

<p>
  Within the <a href="@@strips-list">Strips List</a> pane at the top left of the Mixer
  window, tracks and busses can be freely dragged-and-dropped into any desired
  order.
</p>

<h3>"Collecting" Group Members</h3>

<p>
  Tracks and Busses that are members of a group can be reordered so that they
  display contiguously within the Editor and Mixer windows, by <kbd
  class=mouse>Right</kbd>-clicking on the group tab and choosing <kbd
  class="menu">Collect</kbd>.
</p>

<h2>Ordering of New Tracks</h2>

<p>
  When <a href="@@adding-tracks-busses-and-vcas">adding new tracks</a>, the
  <kbd class="menu">Insert:</kbd> field allows to determine their placement.
  New tracks will be placed <em>Last</em> by default, so after the rightmost
  (in the mixer) or bottom-most (in the editor) selected track. If no tracks are
  selected, new tracks will be added at the end, regardless of the choice.
</p>

<p class="note">
  Because new tracks are automatically selected, they can be quickly reordered
  in the editor window via the keyboard shortcuts after adding them.
</p>

<h2>Track Ordering and Remote Control IDs</h2>

<p>
  Every track and bus in Ardour is assigned a <dfn>remote control ID</dfn>.
  When a <a href="@@control-surfaces">control surface</a> or any other
  remote control is used to control Ardour, these IDs are used to identify
  which track(s) or buss(es) are the intended target of incoming commands.
</p>

<p>
  Remote IDs are assigned to tracks and busses in the order that they appear in
  the mixer window from left to right, starting from #1; manual assignment of
  remote IDs is not possible. The master bus and monitor section can be
  accessed by name.
</p>
