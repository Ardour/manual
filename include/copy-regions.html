<h2>Copy a Single Region</h2>
<p>
  Copying a region is done using the <a href="@@toolbox">Grab mouse mode</a>, by
  moving the mouse pointer into the region and <kbd class="mouse mod1">left</kbd>-dragging.
  Ardour creates a new region and follows the mouse pointer as it moves. See
  <a href="@@move-regions-with-the-mouse">Move Regions</a> for more
  details on moving the copied region.
</p>

<h2>Copy Multiple Regions</h2>
<p>
  Copying multiple regions requires them to be selected before copying. Then
  <kbd class="mouse mod1">left</kbd>-dragging one of the selected regions will copy
  the regions as they move. The copied regions will keep their positions relative
  to each other.
</p>

<h2>Fixed-Time Copying</h2>
<p>
  Copying region(s) to other track(s) while keeping the copies at the
  same exact position on the timeline as the originals is done by simply using a
  <kbd class="mouse mod1">Middle</kbd>-drag instead.
