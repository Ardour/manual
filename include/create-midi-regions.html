  Although recording MIDI is a common way to create new MIDI regions, it is
  often desirable to do so as part of editing/arranging.
</p>
<p>
  Create a new MIDI region is as simple as <kbd
  class="mouse">Left</kbd>-clicking in a MIDI track when <kbd class="menu">Draw Mode</kbd> is enabled. A region will be created
  that is one bar long. It can then be <a href="@@trimming-regions">trimmed</a>
  to any length desired.
</p>
<p>
  Once a region has been created, <a href="@@add-new-notes">some notes</a>
  should be added to it.
