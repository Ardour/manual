  Although recording MIDI is a common way to create new MIDI regions, it is
  often desirable to do so as part of editing/arranging.
</p>
<p>
  Create a new MIDI region is as simple as entering draw mode (press
  "d" or click on the pencil tool) and then <kbd
  class="mouse">Left</kbd>-clicking in a MIDI track. A region will be created
  that is one bar long. Alternatively, use the left button to
  drag-create a new region of the desired length.
</p>
<p>
  Once the region exists, to trim it to a different length, switch
  back to grabber/object/select mode (press "g" or click on the
  grabber tool). It can then
  be <a href="@@trimming-regions">trimmed</a> to any length desired.
</p>
<p>
  Once a region has been created, <a href="@@add-new-notes">some notes</a>
  should be added to it.
