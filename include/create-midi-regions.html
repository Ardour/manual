  Although <a href="@@midi-recording">recording MIDI</a> on an existing track is a common way to create new MIDI regions, it is often desirable to create new MIDI regions as part of the editing and/or arranging process.
</p>

<p>
  A new MIDI region can be created with the mouse by entering <a href="@@toolbox">Draw Mode</a> (entered by pressing the <kbd>d</kbd> key or clicking on the Draw tool) and then <kbd class="mouse">left</kbd>-clicking anywhere in an existing MIDI track; this will create a region that is one bar long. If longer regions are desired, they can be created by <kbd class="mouse">left</kbd>-clicking anywhere in an existing MIDI track and dragging the mouse until the region is the desired length.
</p>

<p class=note>
  Once created, all the typical methods of editing audio regions will work the same as they do for MIDI regions. See <a href="@@editing-regions-and-selections">Editing Regions and Selections</a> for more details.
