<p>
  A <dfn>MIDI track</dfn> is created much like any other track (see <a href="@@adding-tracks-busses-and-vcas">Adding Tracks, Busses and VCAs</a>). However, there are a few things that are unique to creating MIDI tracks.
</p>

<p>
  When adding a MIDI track using the <kbd class="menu">Add Track/Bus/VCA</kbd> dialog, the <kbd class="menu">MIDI Tracks</kbd> item should be highlighted in the <kbd class="menu">Template/Type</kbd> list on the left. This will enable the <kbd class="menu">Instrument</kbd> combobox while disabling the <kbd class="menu">Configuration</kbd> and <kbd class="menu">Record Mode</kbd> comboboxes.
</p>

<p>
  The <kbd class="menu">Instrument</kbd> combobox allows the selection of a plugin for the track to be created that will generate audio in response to MIDI data; if the track is intended to drive an external device then <kbd class="menu">-none-</kbd> should be selected instead.
