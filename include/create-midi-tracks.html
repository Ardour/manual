  To create a new <dfn>MIDI track</dfn>, choose <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; 
  Add Track/Bus</kbd>. In the Add Track/Bus dialog, pick <kbd class="menu">MIDI

  You may decide to use a track template if you have one. 
  You may also know the instrument (a plugin that will generate audio in response 
  to receiving MIDI) that you want to use in the track. The Instrument selector 
  will show you a list of all plugins that you have which accept MIDI input and 
  generate audio output.
