<p>
  <dfn>Location Markers</dfn> appear in the <a href="@@ruler">Locations Markers</a>
  ruler at the top of the timeline. They have multiple uses, most
  commonly&nbsp;&mdash; for navigation in a session, e.g. where this or that
  instrument should start/stop playing. Custom markers can be created at
  any position in a session.
</p>

<p>
  The <dfn style="background-color:limegreen;">start</dfn> and
  <dfn style="background-color:limegreen;">end</dfn> markers, that define the
  length of the session, appear automatically once any content has been added to
  the session (either recorded or imported). The end marker automatically shifts
  to the right once more material gets added.

<h2 id="creating-location-markers">Creating Location Markers</h2>

<p>
  There are multiple ways to create custom markers at the current playhead
  position:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>using the keyboard shortcut (default is <kbd>Tab</kbd>)</li>
  <li>using the <kbd class="menu">Transport &gt; Markers &gt; Add
  Mark from Playhead</kbd> menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Adding a marker at an arbitrary location on the timeline (i.e. not at the
  playhead position) can also be done either by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><kbd class="mouse">right</kbd> clicking in the Location Marker ruler, and
  selecting <kbd class="menu">Add &gt; Location Marker</kbd></li>
  <li>using the <a href="@@the-ranges-and-marks-lists">Ranges &amp; Marks List</a>,
  clicking <kbd class="menu">New Marker</kbd> and using the <a href="@@editing-clocks">
  clock widget</a> to set its position.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="moving-location-markers">Moving Location Markers</h2>

<p>
  <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd>-clicking and dragging moves a single marker to a
  new location on the timeline.
</p>

<p>
  It is possible to move multiple markers by the same distance. <kbd
  class="mouse mod1">Left</kbd>-clicking each marker creates a selection of
  markers that can be dragged left or right together.
</p>

<h2 id="renaming-location-markers">Renaming Location Markers</h2>

<p>
  There are three ways to rename a location marker:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Double-click on a marker opens a dialog where a new name can be submitted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Right-clicking on a marker and selecting <kbd class="menu">Rename….</kbd>
    opens a dialog where a new name can be submitted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Editing and confirming the name by pressing <kbd class="button">Enter</kbd>
    in an entry box in the <em>Ranges&nbsp;&amp; Marks</em> sidebar.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="removing-location-markers">Removing Location Markers</h2>

<p>
  There are three ways to remove a location marker:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Hovering the marker and pressing <kbd class="button">Enter</kbd>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Right-clicking on a marker and selecting <kbd class="menu">Remove</kbd>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clicking the <kbd class="button">x</kbd> for a marker of choice in the
    <em>Ranges&nbsp;&amp; Marks</em> sidebar.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="more-options">More Options</h2>

<p>
  The context (right-click) menu for location markers has more options than the
  ones mentioned above:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr>
    <th>Locate to Here</th>
    <td>
      Moves the playhead to the selected marker.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Play from Here</th>
    <td>
      Moves the playhead to the selected marker and starts playback.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Move Mark to Playhead</th>
    <td>
      This changes the position of the selected marker to that of the playhead.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Create Range to next Marker</th>
    <td>
      This creates a pair of range markers between the selected marker and the
      next one to the right on the timeline.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Promote to Time Origin</th>
    <td>
      This makes the position of the chosen range marker the origin time. This
      is mostly useful when the <em>Display delta to origin marker</em> clock
      mode is enabled to display the difference between current playhead
      position and the origin time. Absolute time stays unaffected.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Hide</th>
    <td>
      This hides the selected marker from the ruler until the user chooses to
      unhide it.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Rename…</th>
    <td>
      This opens a dialog to rename the marker.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Lock</th>
    <td>
      This prevents a marker from being accidentally moved elsewhere.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
