<p>
  <dfn>Range markers</dfn> are essentially two
  <a href="@@creating-location-markers"> location markers</a> that appear in the
  <a href="@@ruler">Range Markers</a> ruler, and are grouped together to mark
  the beginning and end of a section in the timeline.
</p>

<h2>Creating a Range on the Timeline</h2>

<p>
  Creating a new <dfn>range</dfn> can be done by <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd>
  clicking on the Range Markers ruler at the top
  of the timeline, then selecting <kbd class="menu">New Range</kbd>. Two markers
  with the same name and opposing arrows will appear along the ruler.
</p>
<p>
  It is also possible to create range markers from a selected range or
  region in the Editor window, or to using the
  <kbd class="menu">Ranges&nbsp;&amp; Marks List</kbd> in the Editor list.
</p>

<h2>Editing a Range</h2>

<p>
  Both markers of a range can be independently moved along the timeline by clicking and dragging
  them to the desired location.
</p>
<p>
  They can also be moved together by <kbd class="mod2n"></kbd> dragging one marker.
</p>
<p>
  See <a href="@@moving-markers">Moving markers</a> for more information.
</p>

<h3>Renaming Range Markers</h3>

<p>
  Ardour provides two ways to rename an existing pair of range markers:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Double-clicking either of the two range markers will show a dialog for
    setting a new caption for the markers.
  </li>
  <li>
    The same can be achieved by right-clicking on either of the markers and
    selecting the <kbd class="menu">Rename Range…</kbd> menu item.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Removing Range Markers</h2>

<p>
  Range markers can be deleted in three ways:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    By clicking on one of the markers and pressing the <kbd>Del</kbd> key.
  </li>
  <li>
    By right-clicking on one of the markers and selecting
    <kbd class="menu">Remove Range</kbd>.
  </li>
  <li>
    By clicking the markers' <kbd class="button">x</kbd> button in the
    <em>Ranges&nbsp;&amp; Marks</em> sidebar.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>More Options</h2>

<p>
  The context (right-click) menu for range markers has more options than the
  ones mentioned above:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr>
    <th>Play Range</th>
    <td>
      Starts playback at the left marker in the pair and stops at the right
      marker.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Locate to Marker</th>
    <td>
      Moves the playhead to the selected marker.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Play from Marker</th>
    <td>
      Moves the playhead to the selected marker and starts playback.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Loop Range</th>
    <td>
      Creates a loop range off the selected range markers pair and starts
      playback.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Set Marker from Playhead</th>
    <td>
      Changes the position of the selected marker to that of the playhead.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Set Range from Selection</th>
    <td>
      Adjusts the position of range markers to match the current selection.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Zoom to Range</th>
    <td>
      Changes the zoom so that the area defined by the range markers would be
      maximized yet visible entirely within Ardour's window.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Glue to Bars and Beats</th>
    <td>
      When this option is enabled, the marker maintains its position in bars
      and beats even if there are changes in tempo and meter.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Loudness Assistant…</th>
    <td>
      Launches the Loudness Assistant to analyze the selection defined by the
      selected pair of range markers.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Export Range…</th>
    <td>
      Exports the selection defined by the selected pair of range markers.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Promote to Time Origin</th>
    <td>
      This makes the position of the chosen range marker the origin time. This
      is mostly useful when the <em>Display delta to origin marker</em> clock
      mode is enabled to display the difference between current playhead
      position and the origin time. Absolute time stays unaffected.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Hide Range</th>
    <td>
      This hides the range from the Range Markers ruler. Marker's visibility
      can be restored in the <em>Ranges&nbsp;&amp; Marks</em> sidebar.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Separate Regions in Range</th>
    <td>
      Cuts all regions crossing the positions of the range markers.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Select All in Range</th>
    <td>
      Select entire regions that cross the borders of the range markers.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Select Range</th>
    <td>
      Create a selection from the range markers in all selected tracks and
      busses.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
