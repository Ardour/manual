<h2>Editing notes</h2>

<p>
	There are two available editing modes: Draw and Edit.
</p>

<p>
	With the Draw mode, you can:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Add new notes with predefined length by setting the length in the editor toolbar and single-clicking on the timeline.
	</li>
	<li>
		Draw notes with custom length by clicking on the timeline and dragging to the right.
	</li>
	<li>
		Brush notes by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>, clicking, and dragging to the right. New notes will be painted at an interval defined by global quantization, with the length defined in the editor toolbar.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	See this <a href="@@add-new-notes#add-new-notes-using-the-mouse">chapter</a> for details on adding MIDI notes.
</p>

<p>
	With the Edit mode, you can:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Select multiple notes:
		<ul>
			<li>with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> for any separate notes you click;</li>
			<li>with <kbd>Shift</kbd> for all notes between the currently selected note and the clicked-on note;</li>
			<li>with rubberband selection cue by clicking on an empty area and draggin towards notes.</li>
		</ul>

		Trim and extend notes by pointing at their left/right sides, clicking, and dragging the edges.
	</li>
	<li>Split and join notes using <kbd>S</kbd> and <kbd>J</kbd> shortcuts. <a href="@@note-splitting-joining">See this chapter</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Editing automation</h2>

<p>
	You can create new automation in the Draw mode and edit existing automation in the Edit mode. Please refer to <a href="@@track-automation">this chapter</a> for details on editing workflows and methods.
</p>

<p>
	The automation editing area displays note velocity and controllers and is disabled by default. Clicking on any of the available controller options (Velocity, Bender, Pressure, Modulation) enables it.
</p>

<p>
	To enable or disable an automation lane, click on the small LED indicator to the left of its name on the bottom toolbar.
</p>

<p>
	The area can display data from multiple controllers, overlaid on top of each other, but only one automation lane is editable at the time.
