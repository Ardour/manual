<p>
  <dfn>Cue markers</dfn> allow bridging linear and non-linear approaches to
  composing music. The idea is that a user can set up entire cues, then place a
  cue marker on the timeline to launch a cue of choice at a particular point in
  time. The workflow is explained in more details in the
  <a href="@@mixing-linear-nonlinear-workflows">Mixing Linear and Non-Linear Workflows</a> section.
</p>

<p>
  Cue markers are displayed in the Location Markers ruler.

<h2 id="moving-cure-markers">Moving Cue Markers</h2>

<p>
  <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd>-clicking and dragging moves a single marker to a
  new location on the timeline.
</p>

<p>
  It is possible to move multiple markers by the same distance. <kbd
  class="mouse mod1">Left</kbd>-clicking each marker creates a selection of
  markers that can be dragged left or right together.
</p>

<h2 id="moving-single-marker">Single marker</h2>
<p>
  <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd>-clicking and dragging moves a single marker to a
  new location on the timeline.
</p>

<h2 id="moving--multiple-markers">Multiple markers</h2>
<p>
  It is possible to move multiple markers by the same distance. <kbd
  class="mouse mod1">Left</kbd>-clicking each discrete marker, or <kbd
  class="mouse mod3">Left</kbd>-clicking the first and last markers of a range
  of markers selects them, then dragging one to a new location will move all
  selected markers together.
</p>

<h2 id="stopping-all-cues">Stopping All Cues</h2>

<p>
  Ardour has a special kind of a marker that immediately stops all playing cues.
  This marker (<kbd class="menu">Stop All Cues</kbd>) can be added via the
  right-click menu on the Cue Markers ruler.
</p>

<h2 id="removing-cure-markers">Removing Cue Markers</h2>

<p>
  Right-clicking on an existing cue marker opens the context menu with a number
  of options. Choosing <kbd class="menu">Remove</kbd> will delete the cue marker
  of choice.
</p>

<p>
  When all existing cue markers have to be removed, the best option is to
  right-click on the Cue Markers ruler (any place except an existing marker) and
  choose <kbd class="menu">Clear All Cues</kbd>. This will delete all cue
  markers in the session.
</p>

<h2 id="more-options">More Options</h2>

<p>
  The context menu for existing markers provides several more options:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr>
  	<th>Set Cue:</th>
  	<td>Picking a cue from the list here will replace the selected marker with
  	a marker for a different cue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<th>Locate to Here</th>
  	<td>This will move the playhead to the cue marker's position.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<th>Play from Here</th>
  	<td>This will move the playhead to the cue marker's position and start
  	playback.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<th>Move Mark to Playhead</th>
  	<td>This will move the selected cue marker to the current position of the
  	Playhead.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
