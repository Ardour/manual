	You can record audio and MIDI from respective inputs into trigger slots to play them back. Here is the workflow.

<ol>
	<li>On the Cue page, Click on the record button at the top of the track you want to record to.</li>
	<li>Select a trigger slot</li>
	<li>Enable Follow Length in Follow Options at the bottom</li>
	<li>Set the follow length in beats</li>
	<li>Click to the left of the selected trigger slot to enable recording</li>
	<li>Click the Play button in the transport toolbar or press <kbd>Space</kbd></li>
</ol>

<p>
	Ardour will count down (the number of beats depends on launch quantization and position of the playhead) and start recording. 
</p>
<p>
	As soon as the playhead reaches the end of the defined follow length, Ardour will stop recording and start playing back the clip you've just recorded.
