<p>
	For cues, Ardour generally follows the design pattern of other applications
	that support a grid-based non-linear workflow. Here are themain elements
	of the <dfn>Cue</dfn> window.

<ol>
	<li>Grid comprised of tracks and cues</li>
	<li>Processor box</li>
	<li>Per-track controls</li>
	<li>Sidebar with the tabs: Clips, Tracks, Sources, Regions</li>
	<li>Bottom bar with options for clips and trigger slots</li>
</ol>

<h2>Grid</h2>

<p>Grid: tracks and cues. FIXME</p>

<p>Slot: launch indicator, title, follow action indicator. FIXME

<h2>Playback Indication</h2>

<p>FIXME</p>

<h2>Processor Box</h2>

<p>
	Similarly to the ordinary track, this is where you assign a virtual
	instrument to a MIDI track and/or add effects to be applied to all clips
	in a track regardless of what scene they belong to.
</p>

<h2>Per-Track Controls</h2>

<p>
	Again, similarly to ordinary tracks, this is where you tweak the fader
	and panner positions, mute or solo an entire track.
</p>

<h2>Sidebar</h2>

<p>
	Ardour defaults to displaying the Clips tab as the clips browser
	is commonly used for pulling reusable clips into the project.
</p>

<p>
	You can also access the list of tracks, which in the context of the Cue
	window is mostly useful to mark a track as visible or not visible in the
	Cue window.
</p>

<p>
	Additionally, you can pick a source or a region in the <dfn>Sources</dfn>
	or <dfn>Regions</dfn> tabs respectively and drop them in the <dfn>Clips</dfn>
	tab to copy a reusable item to your custom library of clips.
</p>

<h2>Bottom Bar</h2>

<p>
	The bottom bar contains three or four groups of controls depending on the
	type of a clip, audio or MIDI.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><dfn>Clip Properties</dfn>: FIXME</li>
	<li><dfn>Launch Options</dfn>: FIXME</li>
	<li><dfn>Follow Actions</dfn>: FIXME</li>
	<li><dfn>Stretch Options</dfn> (audio-only): FIXME</li>
</ul>
