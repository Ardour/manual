<p>
  Almost every available function in Ardour can be bound to a keyboard
  shortcut (and those few that cannot will usually respond to an <a
  href="@@controlling-ardour-with-osc"><abbr
  title="Open Sound Control">OSC</abbr> command</a>). Ardour comes with a
  rich set of default <dfn>key bindings</dfn> for the most commonly used
  functions.
</p>

<p>
  These bindings strive to be <dfn>mnemonic</dfn>, that is, easy and intuitive
  to remember, and follow widely accepted conventions. As a general rule, the
  first letter of an operation will be used for as a shortcut, if available.
  This does not necessarily lead to the best ergonomics for rapid
  editing&mdash;there are alternative binding sets for that&mdash;but it does
  make it simpler for newcomers to remember some of the most useful ones, for
  example:
</p>

<p>
  <kbd>S</kbd> for <kbd class="menu">Region &gt; Edit &gt; Split</kbd>
  or
  <kbd>P</kbd> for <kbd class="menu">Transport &gt; Playhead &gt; Playhead to
  Mouse</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
  Existing key bindings in menus are listed on the right side of the menu
  items.
</p>

<p>
  Almost every key binding in Ardour can be looked for and/or changed in
  <kbd class="menu">Window &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts</kbd> (which is bound to <kbd
  class="mod2">K</kbd>).
</p>

<p class="warning">
  Ardour will warn you with a "Colliding Keybindings" message, if you try to
  reassign the binding of a key combination that is already in use.
  Nevertheless if you do so, consider, that
  this might lead to confusion when asking for help&mdash;when the
  explanation is given in terms of a standard key binding&mdash;which will have
  a completely different effect on the system with the modified key bindings.
</p>

<p>
  The conventions for using modifier keys (<kbd class="mod1n"></kbd>, <kbd
  class="mod2n"></kbd>, <kbd class="mod3n"></kbd>, etc.) differ among
  platforms, so different default bindings for each are provided.
