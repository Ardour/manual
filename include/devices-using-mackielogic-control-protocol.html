  This will walk you through the process of configuring and using
  a MIDI control surface with Ardour that uses the <dfn>Mackie Control
  protocol</dfn> (MCP) or <dfn>Logic Control protocol</dfn>. Devices that
  have been tested and are known to work include the SSL Nucleus, Mackie
  Control Pro (plus extenders), Behringer devices in Mackie/Logic mode,
  and Steinberg CMC devices.
</p>

<h2>Enabling Mackie Control in Ardour</h2>
<p>
  Navigate to <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Control Surfaces</kbd>.
  Tick the <kbd class="option">Mackie</kbd> option and click on the
  <kbd class="menu">Show Protocol Settings</kbd> button to see the setup dialog:

<p>
  From the selector at the top, choose the type of device you are using.

  What to do if your device is not listed</a>).
</p>

<p class="fixme">Update the controls description</p>

<p>
  Once your setup is complete, click "OK" to close the dialog. Now click
  on the enable checkbox for "Mackie Control".
</p>
<h2>Devices using ipMIDI</h2>
<p>
  If you are using a device that uses ipMIDI, such as the SSL Nucleus, no
  MIDI port connections are required&mdash;Ardour and your control
  surface will be able to talk to each other automatically so long as
  your control surface and computer are both connected to the same network.
</p>
<h2>Connecting control surface and Ardour MIDI ports</h2>
<p>
  Before attempting to use a Mackie Control device that communicates via
  a standard MIDI cable or a USB cable, you should ensure that
  <a href="@@midi-on-linux">your Linux
  MIDI environment is setup</a>.
  If you are using a device that uses normal MIDI (via a standard MIDI or
  USB cable), you need to connect Ardour's Mackie Control in and out ports
  to the MIDI ports leading to and coming from the control surface.
</p>
<p>
  When you have made these connections once, Ardour will recreate them
  for you in the future, as long as you leave Mackie Control enabled.
</p>

<h2>Customizing your control surface</h2>
<p>
  Every possible global Mackie Control button can be bound to any <a
  href="@@list-of-menu-actions">
  action</a> present in Ardour's GUI. Please check your control surface
  page for suggestions.
</p>

<h2>Preparing your device for use with Ardour</h2>
<p>
  Most interfaces will require some configuration to send and respond to
  MCP.
</p>

<p class="note">
  When setting up the control surface, do <em>not</em> use "Pro Tools"
  mode. Pro Tools is the only DAW that still requires HUI. The rest of
  world uses Mackie Control Protocol. Ardour does not support HUI at
  this time.
