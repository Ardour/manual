<p>
  Ardour's handling of <dfn>MIDI editing</dfn> differs from most other DAWs
  and MIDI sequencers.
</p>

<h2>Key features of Ardour MIDI handling</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    All editing is done in-place, in-window. There is no separate piano roll
    window or pane. Edit notes right where you see them.
  </li>
  <li>
    MIDI, just like audio, exists in regions. MIDI regions behave like audio
    regions: they can be moved, trimmed, copied (cloned), or deleted. Ardour allows
    either editing MIDI (or audio) regions, or MIDI region content (the notes), but
    never both at the same time. The <kbd class="menu">e</kbd> key (by default)
    toggles between region level and note level editing
  </li>
  <li>
    Editing note information in Ardour occurs in only a single region. There is no
    way currently to edit in note data for multiple regions at the same time, so for
    example notes cannot be selected in several regions and then all deleted, nor
    can they be copied-and-pasted from one region to another. Region(s), though, can
    be copy-pasted just as with audio. 
  </li>
  <li>
    All MIDI I/O is done via JACK for sample accurate timing and maximal
    efficiency when communicating with external software synthesizers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every MIDI track has its own JACK MIDI port for input; it may have an
    arbitrary combination of audio and MIDI outputs, depending on the signal
    processing in the track; the full flexibility of JACK connectivity is
    present for MIDI just as it is for audio.
  </li>
  <li>
    Full automation for MIDI tracks, integrated with the handling of all MIDI
    CC data for each track.
  </li>
  <li>
    Controllers (CC data) can be set to discrete or continuous modes (the
    latter will interpolate between control points and send additional
    data).
  </li>
  <li>
    There is a Normal and a  Percussive mode for note data editing.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <dfn>scroomer</dfn> is a combination scroll/zoom tool for altering
    the zoom level and range of visible MIDI data.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Notable Differences</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fader (volume) control currently operates on transmitted MIDI data, not by sending CC
    #7.
  </li>
  <li>
    All note/data editing is per-region. There are no cross-region operations at this
    time.
  </li>
  <li>
    By default, copying a MIDI region creates a <dfn>deep link</dfn>&mdash;both
    regions share the same data source, and edits to the contents of
    one will affect the other. To break this link, select
    <kbd class="menu">MIDI &gt; Unlink from other copies</kbd> from the region
    context menu, after which the selected region(s) will have their own copies
    of <em>only</em> the data that they visually display on screen. You will not
    be able to trim the region back its original length after an Unlink operation,
    and the operation cannot be undone.
  </li>
</ul>
