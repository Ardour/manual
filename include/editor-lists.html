<p>
	The Editor and the Cue windows have an optional area called
	<dfn>Editor list</dfn>. It contains multiple lists: tracks and busses,
	sources, regions, reusable clips, various markers etc.
</p>

<p>
	The Editor list is not shown by default when you run Ardour for the first
	time. It can be hidden or shown using <kbd class="menu">View &gt; Show
	Editor List</kbd> menu command. The left-hand border of the list can be
	dragged to show more columns where appropriate (alternatively, you can
	scroll the bottom scrollbar to see more).

<p>
	The Cue window displays only a part of all possible lists&nbsp;&mdash;
	ones that make sense for this non-linear sequencer: Clips, Tracks, Sources,
	and Regions.
