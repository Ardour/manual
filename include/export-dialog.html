<p>
  When you have finished mixing your session, you probably want to export it to a sound
  file to burn to a CD, upload to the web, or whatever. <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Export &gt; Export to Audio file(s)&hellip;</kbd>
  shows the Export Dialog to do this.
</p>

<p>
  You can also export the outputs of multiple tracks and busses all at once via
  <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Export &gt; Stem Export&hellip;</kbd>.
</p>

<h2>File Format</h2>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  This tab contains controls for the format of the exported audio file.
  You can enable more than one format here, in which case each will be exported in turn.
  Ardour is supplied with a list of export formats, including:
</p>

<ul>
<li>CD (Red Book)</li>
<li>DVD-A</li>
<li>FLAC 24 bit </li>
<li>FLAC 24 bit (tagged)</li>
<li>Ogg_Vorbis</li>
<li>Ogg_Vorbis (tagged)</li>
<li>Ring Tone</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You can edit these formats, or create your own, with the <a href="@@export-format-profiles">"Edit Export Format Profile"</a> dialog, which
  appears when you click the "Edit" or "New" button to the right of the drop-down list of formats.
</p>

<p>
  You can also create a 'Preset' consisting of one or more formats. Ardour provides some ready-made presets, too:
</p>

<ul>
<li>CD + DVD-A</li>
<li>CD + FLAC</li>
<li>CD + FLAC (tagged)</li>
<li>CD + Ogg_Vorbis + FLAC (tagged)</li>
<li>CD + Ogg_Vorbis</li>
<li>CD + Ogg_Vorbis (tagged)</li>
<li>CD only</li>
<li>DVD-A only</li>
<li>FLAC</li>
<li>FLAC (tagged)</li>
<li>Ogg_Vorbis + FLAC</li>
<li>Ogg_Vorbis + FLAC (tagged)</li>
<li>Ogg_Vorbis </li>
<li>Ogg_Vorbis (tagged)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The location</h2>

<p>
  Aside from providing a way to tell Ardour <em>where</em> to put the created file(s),
  the <dfn>location</dfn> part of the window allows to name the exported files with
  a lot of choice regarding the naming convention, hence blending into the user's
  workflow, and providing a clean way to keep the export folders from beeing cluttered
  with poorly named files.
</p>
<p>
  The name of the file(s) can optionnaly be made of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The session or snapshot's name</li>
  <li>A custom label (i.e., any text)</li>
  <li>A revision number</li>
  <li>The name of the timespan (see below)</li>
  <li>A date (in multiple formats)</li>
  <li>A time (also in multiple format).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Soundcloud upload</h2>
<p>
  When 'Upload to Soundcloud' is ticked on in any format's tab, a pane containing fields
  to enter in Soundcloud account details (email and password), and what should happen
  to the uploaded files will become visible.
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>Make files public</th>
      <td>Choose whether to make uploaded files available to anyone via the Soundcloud web site.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Open uploaded files in browser</th>
      <td>Open each file on soundcloud in your browser after upload.
      If you don't enable this, you can still see the URLs in the Log window.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Make files downloadable</th>
      <td>Choose whether to allow downloading of files uploaded to Soundcloud.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Analyze exported audio</h2>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/export-report-analysis.png" alt="The Export Report/Analysis window">
  <figcaption>
    The Export Report/Analysis window
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Checking <kbd class="option">Analyze Exported Audio</kbd> shows the Export Report/Analysis
  window. This provides a lot of useful information about the exported file:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the file name and location</li>
  <li>its format</li>
  <li>its channel count</li>
  <li>its sample rate</li>
  <li>its duration and timecode.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  It also allows to <kbd class="menu">Play</kbd> the file, and the <kbd class="menu">
  Open Folder</kbd> button gives a quick access to the place where it has been created.
</p>
<p>
  The most prominent feature though, are the two generated views of the audio file
  in time (waveform) and frequency (sonograph) domain, and the loudness
  analysis, giving:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Peak value</li>
  <li>the True Peak value (to take inter sample peaks into account)</li>
  <li>the Normalization Gain (if it has been applied)</li>
  <li>the Integrated Loudness</li>
  <li>the loudness range</li>
  <li>a graph of the multiplicity of the peaks at the different loudness levels.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Time Span</h2>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/export-dialog-timespan.png" alt="The Time Span tab">

    The Time Span tab
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  This tab allows you to select the range (or ranges) of the timeline to export. By default, "session" is
  enabled&mdash;this will export the whole session from the start marker to the end marker.
</p>

<h2>Channels</h2>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/export-dialog-channels.png" alt="The Channels tab">
  <figcaption>
    The Channels tab
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Here you can choose which outputs (tracks or busses) should be sent to the exported file.
</p>

<h2>Stem Export</h2>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/export-dialog-stem-export.png" alt="Stem export">
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  If you chose 'Stem Export', the 'Channels' tab appears slightly differently:
  in this case each chosen channel (track or bus) is exported to its own file,
  instead of all channels being mixed together into a single file. You can
  choose to export either the region contents or the track output here in this
  case.
