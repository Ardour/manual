<p>
  Like a normal aux send, an <dfn>external send</dfn> taps the signal at a
  specific point within a channel strip, but delivers it to an external application
  or piece of hardware rather than an Ardour bus. By itself, an external
  send has no effect whatsoever on the audio signals within Ardour&mdash;it
  is a one-way signal routing that leaves all existing signal processing
  just as it was.
</p>

<p>
  Most people will not have much use for this, but it can be useful to experiment
  with external applications or hardware signal processing applications.
</p>

<h2>Adding an External Send</h2>

<p>
  Context-clicking on the
  <a href="@@processor-box">processor box</a> in a
  channel strip (at the desired location, pre or post fader) and choosing
  <kbd class="menu">Add new External Send</kbd> will show a dialog containing the
  standard Ardour <a href="@@patchbay"><dfn>patchbay</dfn></a> to allow
  to connect the send to the desired destination.
</p>

<h2>Removing an External Send</h2>

<p>An external send can be removed in several ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><kbd class="mouse mod3">Right</kbd>-clicking the send in the processor box and
  choosing either <kbd class="menu">Cut</kbd> or <kbd class="menu">Delete</kbd>.</li>
<li>Selecting the send (with a single <kbd class="mouse">left</kbd> click) and
  pressing the <kbd>Del</kbd> key.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Altering Send Levels</h2>

<p>
  Just below the send in the processor box is a small fader that can be used
  like all other faders in Ardour to control the gain applied to the signal
  delivered by the send. Dragging it alters the level, Shift-click restores
  to unity (0dB) gain.
</p>

<h2>Disabling Sends</h2>
<p>
  Clicking the small LED in the send display within the processor box turns
  it on and off. When turned off, silence will be delivered to the send. When
  turned on, the signal within the channel strip will be delivered.
</p>

<h2>Editing Send Routing</h2>

<p>
  Double-clicking on the send in the processor box will re-display the patchbay
  dialog that gives full control over the routing of the send, as well as
  additional controls: gain fader, panner, signal meter, and phase inverter.
