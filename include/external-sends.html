  Like a normal aux send, an <dfn>external send</dfn> taps the signal at a 
  specific within a channel strip, but delivers it to an external application 
  or piece of hardware rather than an Ardour bus. By itself, an external 
  send has no effect whatsoever on the audio signals within Ardour &mdash; 
  it is a one-way signal routing that leaves all existing signal processing 
  just as it was.
</p>
<p>
  Most people will not have much use for this, but it can be useful if you 
  want to experiment with external applications or hardware signal processing 
  applications.
</p>

<h2>Adding an External Send</h2>
<p>
  Context-click on the 
  <a href="/working-with-plugins/processor-box/">processor box</a> in a 
  channel strip (at the desired location, pre or post fader) and choose 
  <kbd class="menu">Add new External Send</kbd>. A dialog will appear 
  containing the standard Ardour 
  <a href="/signal-routing/Patchbay/"><dfn>patchbay</dfn></a> to allow 
  you to connect the send to the desired destination. 
</p>

<h2>Removing an External Send</h2>
<p>You can remove an external send in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd class="mouse mod3">Right</kbd>-click the send in the processor box.</li>
<li>Position the pointer over the send and press the <kbd>Del</kbd> key.</li>
<li>Position the pointer over the send and press <kbd class="mod1">x</kbd>.</li>
<li>Context-click the send and choose either <kbd class="menu">Cut</kbd> or 
  <kbd class="menu">Delete</kbd>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Altering Send Levels</h2>
<p>
  Just below the send in the processor box is a small fader that can be used 
  like all other faders in Ardour to control the gain applied to the signal 
  delivered by the send. Drag it to alter the level, Shift-click to restore 
  to unity (0dB) gain. 
</p>

<h2>Disabling Sends</h2>
<p>
  Click the small "LED" in the send display within the processor box to turn 
  it on and off. When turned off, silence will be delivered to the send. When 
  turned on, the signal within the channel strip will be delivered.
</p>
<h2>Editing Send Routing</h2>
<p>
  Double-clicking or Edit-clicking on the send in the processor box will 
  redisplay the patchbay dialog that allows you full control over the routing 
  of the send.
