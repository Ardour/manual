<p>
  The <dfn>Favorite Plugins</dfn> window is on the top-left side of the <dfn>Mixer Window</dfn>. Like other elements in that window it has variable height and can be hidden by dragging it to zero-height. If it is not visible, the top-handle can be grabbed and dragged down to reveal it.
</p>

<p>
  Plugin names that have a right facing triangle next to them have presets associated with them; clicking on the triangle will cause all presets associated with the plugin to show in the list.

  The Favorite Plugins window provides easy access to frequently used plugins:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plugins can be dragged from the window to any track or bus <a href="@@processor-box"><dfn>processor box</dfn></a>, which will add the plugin to that track or bus at the given position.</li>
  <li>The list includes user-presets for the plugins. Dragging a preset to a given track or bus will load that preset after adding the plugin.</li>
  <li>Double-clicking on a plugin or preset adds the given plugin to all selected tracks/busses pre-fader. Other insert positions are available from the context menu (right click).</li>
  <li>Dragging a plugin from a track into the window will add it to the list and optionally create a new preset from the current settings. The horizontal line in the list shows the spot where the plugin will land.</li>
  <li>The context-menu allows the deletion of presets or removal of the plugin from the list.</li>
  <li>Plugins in the list can be re-ordered using drag &amp; drop. The custom order is saved.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
  When favorites are added with the <a href="@@plugin-manager">Plugin Manager</a>, they are appended to the bottom of the list.
