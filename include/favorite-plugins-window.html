<p>
  The <dfn>Favorite Plugins</dfn> window is on the top-left side of the 
  <dfn>Mixer Window</dfn>.
</p>

<p>
	A selector at the top allows to switch between different views of the
	favorites:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<dfn>Favorite Plugins</dfn> which have been selected by the user as such,
	</li>
	<li>
		<dfn>Recent Plugins</dfn> which are the <em>n</em> last used plugins,
		<em>n</em> being a chosen value in the <em>Statistics</em> section
		of the <a href="@@preferences#preferences-plugins">Preferences</a>,
	</li>
	<li>
		<dfn>Top-10 Plugins</dfn> which are the <em>n</em> most used plugins,
		<em>n</em> being also chosen value in the Preferences (so it is more
		of a "Top-<em>n</em>").
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	At the bottom of the window is a search field to look for a specific
	plugin.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
  The Favorite Plugins window provides easy access to frequently used plugins:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
	  Plugin names that have a right facing triangle (&#9655;) next to them have presets
	  associated with them; clicking on the triangle will cause all presets
	  associated with the plugin to show in the list.
  </li>
  <li>
	  Plugins can be dragged from the window to any track or bus 
	  <a href="@@processor-box"><dfn>processor box</dfn></a>, which will add
	  the plugin to that track or bus at the given position.
  </li>
  <li>
	  The list includes user-presets for the plugins. Dragging a preset
	  to a given track or bus will load that preset after adding the plugin.
  </li>
  <li>
	  Double-clicking on a plugin or preset adds the given plugin to all
	  selected tracks/busses pre-fader. Other insert positions are available
	  from the context menu (right click).
  </li>
  <li>
	  Dragging a plugin from a track into the window will add it to the
	  list and optionally create a new preset from the current settings.
	  The horizontal line in the list shows the spot where the plugin will
	  land.
  </li>
  <li>
	  The context-menu allows the deletion of presets or removal of the
	  plugin from the list.
  </li>
  <li>
	  Plugins in the list can be re-ordered using drag &amp; drop. The
	  custom order is saved.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
  When favorites are added with the <a href="@@plugin-selector">Plugin Selector</a>,
  they are appended to the bottom of the list.
