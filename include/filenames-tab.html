<p>
  This tab is used to change how Ardour names recorded regions.
  If <dfn>Prefix track number</dfn> is selected a unique number will appear on each track
  in the <dfn>Editor</dfn> window and will prefix the region name. If the track number
  is 2 and the region would have been Gtr-1.1 with track number prefix turned on the region
  will be named 2_Gtr-1.1 instead.  See XX for base of the region name.
</p>

<p>
  If <dfn>Prefix take name</dfn> is selected and the <dfn>Take name</dfn> has Take1 the region
  will have the name Take1_Gtr-1.1 instead.  If both boxes are checked the name will be
  Take1_2_Gtr-1.1 instead.
</p>

<p>
  When <dfn>Prefix take name</dfn> is enabled, the first time a track is recorded it will
  have the specified take name.  When recording is stopped, any trailing number on the
  end of the take name will incremented by 1. If the track name specified doen't have
  a number on the end, the number 1 will be suffixed.
