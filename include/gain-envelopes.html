<p>
  In Ardour, every audio <dfn>region</dfn> has a <dfn>gain envelope</dfn>. It is
  a form of automated gain change that is embedded in the region. The gain
  envelope remains associated with the region when it is moved or copied.
</p>
<p>
  Region Gain envelope is only visible in Draw and Edit Mode. Clicking on the
  Draw tool will cause all the gain envelopes on all regions to show themselves;
  these will appear as lines with square dots (<dfn>control points</dfn>) at the
  beginning and end of each region. The vertical axis represents gain, with the
  top of the region representing +6dB and the bottom representing -inf dB
  (silence). By default, the line starts and ends at 0dB; the control points can
  be moved up and down to change the amount of gain at that point.
</p>

<p>
  Gain follows the line between control points continuously and accurately
  during playback, and adjusts the gain for that region accordingly. Unlike
  fader gain <a href="@@automation">automation</a>, region-gain is not smoothed
  (to prevent zipper-noise or amplitude modulation).
</p>

<h2 style="clear: both">Manipulating Gain Envelopes</h2>

<p>
  The default enveloipe is neutal (0dB) and disabled (gray line). Changing the
  gain by dragging any of the two existing points or adding new points in draw
  mode automatically enables the envelope.  Clicking anywhere in the region
  where there are no existing control points adds a control point to the
  envelope; it will appear <em>on the line</em> at the X-axis of the mouse's
  current position in the region.
</p>

<p>
  Region Gain Envelope can be disabed for selected regions via
  <kbd class="menu">Region &gt; Gain &gt; Envelope Active<kbd>.

<p>
  Once added, a control point can be <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd> clicked and
  dragged to the desired location. Hovering over a control point will show its
  current level in dB. <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd> clicking a control point
  and pressing <kbd>Delete</kbd>, or <kbd class="mod3 mouse">Right</kbd>
  clicking a control point deletes it.
