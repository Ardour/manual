  Generic Midi allows synthesizers and other devices communicate with
  Ardour. MIDI devices can send commands relating to playback (such as
  play or stop), performance (such as volume, play, stop), and almost any
  other function (such as Edit, or Undo).

  Many MIDI control surfaces use predefined MIDI protocols such as the
  "Mackie Control Protocol". In such cases it is best to use Ardour's
  implementation of that protocol as it is likely more feature complete.
