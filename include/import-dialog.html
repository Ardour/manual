<p>
  Many sessions will require the use of <dfn>existing material</dfn>,
  whether it consists of audio and/or MIDI data. Using existing samples,
  loops and riffs from files stored on the system can be the basis for
  a new session, or a way to deepen and improve one that is already
  underway.
</p>
<p>
  Importing audio and MIDI data into the session is done with the
  <dfn>Add Existing Media</dfn> dialog, accessed either by the
  <kbd class="menu"> Session &gt; Import</kbd> menu or, if any tracks have
  already been added, by right-clicking on the canvas of the <dfn>Editor</dfn>
  window and choosing <kbd class="menu">Insert Existing Media</kbd>.
</p>

<h2>The Soundfile Information Box</h2>
<p>
  This box will display information about the currently selected file:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>number of channels,</li>
  <li>sample rate,</li>
  <li>file format,</li>
  <li>length,</li>
  <li>embedded timestamp (applies to some professional formats such as
  Broadcast WAVE), and</li>
  <li><a href="@@searching-for-files-using-tags">tags</a> (attached metadata to help categorize files in a library).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If the sample rate differs from the current session rate, it is displayed
  in red, which indicates that the file must be resampled before
  importing.
</p>
<p>
  Resampling is controlled by the <kbd class="menu">Conversion quality</kbd>
  option described below.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h2>Auditioner</h2>
<p>
  Files can be auditioned before importing. The slider under the play and
  stop buttons allows to scrub around, a fader on the right side allows
  to control the playback volume.
</p>
<p>
  Auditioning MIDI files requires a MIDI instrument to be chosen in the <kbd class="menu">
  Instrument</kbd> dropdown list.
</p>

<h2>Importing options</h2>
<p>
  Through the <kbd class="menu">Add files&hellip;</kbd> option, imported files can be inserted in the session:
</p>
<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>as new tracks</th><td>automatically creates new tracks and import the files in it</td></tr>
  <tr><th>to region list</th><td>adds the files to the <a href="@@the-region-list">region list</a>, from where then can be manually dragged into a track</td></tr>
  <tr><th>as new tape tracks</th><td>adds the files as <a href="@@track-types">Tape tracks.</a></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
  The <kbd class="menu">Insert at</kbd> option chooses where in time the file will be imported, amongst:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the <dfn>file timestamp</dfn> (if available, zero by default)</li>
  <li>at the <a href="@@edit-point-control"><dfn>edit point</dfn></a></li>
  <li>at the <dfn>playhead</dfn></li>
  <li>at the <dfn>session start</dfn>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Channel <kbd class="menu">Mapping</kbd> option is only available for
  multi-channel files (i.e. all but mono ones). It is either
</p>
<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>one track/region per file</th><td>Creates a multi channel track for each imported file</td></tr>
  <tr><th>one track/region per channel</th><td>Creates only mono channels, as many as there are channels in the imported files</td></tr>
  <tr><th>sequence files</th><td>If multiple files are imported, they can be sequenced into a single track in the order of selection</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
  The <kbd class="menu">Conversion quality</kbd> drop-down controls the
  quality of the resampling process, if the sampling rate of the source file
  differs from the session rate.
</p>
<p>
  There are three MIDI-specific options as well. First off, you can set a track 
  naming scheme:
</p>
<table class="dl">
  <tr>
    <th>
      by track number
    </th>
    <td>
      will automatically assign every track a name that consists of the
      imported file name and a track number
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>
      by track name
    </th>
   <td>
      will automatically assign every track a name that consists of the
      imported track's name and number
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>
      by instrument name
    </th>
    <td>
      will automatically assign every track a name that consists of the
      imported instrument's name and a track number
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
<p>
  You can also optionally import a tempo map from a MIDI file.
  The <kbd class="menu">Use MIDI Tempo Map</kbd> option appears when a MIDI
  file is selected in the file selection dialog.
<p>
<p>
  The last MIDI-specific option is <kbd class="menu">Import MIDI Markers</kbd>.
  If those are present in a MIDI file, they will be rendered right above MIDI
  clips on the canvas. Editing the MIDI markers is currently unavailable.
  If MIDI lyrics is available in the file, it was also be imported as region
  markers (that can be later promoted to location markers).

</figure>
</p>
<p>
  Finally, and most importantly, the files can be linked or copied to the session
  with the <kbd class="option">Copy files to session</kbd> checkbox. Please read
  <a href="@@copying-versus-linking">Copying
  versus Linking</a> for details.
</p>

<h2>Importing from FreeSound.org</h2>

<p>
  Ardour can import sounds from the public library at FreeSound.org.
  This feature requires an account with the online service.
</p>

<p>
  Sound clips on FreeSound.org typically have metadata in form of tags
  that give a general idea what sound is recorded in a clip. Ardour will
  use that metadata to find sound clips that match your request.
</p>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="/images/freesound-clips-list.png" alt="List of sound clips found on FreeSound.org" width="75%">
  <figcaption>
    List of sound clips found on FreeSound.org
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  There are two more options for the search:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><dfn>Sort</dfn>: allows sorting all sound clips that match your
  request in a particular order. Changing the type of sorting requires
  running the search again.</li>
  <li><dfn>License</dfn>: allows limiting your search by choosing
  a particular license depending on how you license your own work.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Ardour will list all sounds clips that match your request right in the
  window. If there are a lot of option, click the
  <kbd class="button">More</kbd> button to load the next page with results.
</p>

<p>
  When you click on any sound clip in the list for the first time,
  a FreeSound.org login page will open in your preferred web browser.
</p>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="/images/freesound-login.png" alt="Log into FreeSound.org" width="75%">
  <figcaption>
    Log into FreeSound.org
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>
  You will then be asked to grant access to Ardour.
</p>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="/images/freesound-grant-access.png" alt="Grant access to Ardour" width="75%">
  <figcaption>
    Grant access to Ardour
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>
  Once you do that, FreeSound.org will generate authorization code that you need to select and copy to the clipboard.
</p>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="/images/freesound-auth-code.png" alt="Authorization token" width="75%">
  <figcaption>
    Authorization code
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>
  Finally, insert the code into the entry box here and click <kbd class="button">OK</kbd>.
</p>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="/images/freesound-code-insert.png" alt="Insert authorization token" width="75%">
  <figcaption>
    Insert authorization code
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>
  After that, Ardour will be able to download clips for preview in a folder
  for temporary files that you can select in the
  <kbd class="window">Preferences</kbd> dialog on the
  <kbd class="windows">General</kbd> page.
</p>

<p>
  You can preview and insert clips from FreeSound.org like any other sound
  files.
</p>

<p>
  Please note that authorization code only works as long as Ardour is running.
  The next time you start Ardour, you will need to authorize it again. This is
  implementation specifics of FreeSound.org.
</p>
