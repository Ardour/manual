<p>
  Many sessions will require the use of <dfn>existing material</dfn>,
  whether it consists of audio and/or MIDI data. Using existing samples,
  loops and riffs from files stored on the system can be the basis for
  a new session, or a way to deepen and improve one that is already
  underway.
</p>
<p>
  Importing audio and MIDI data into the session is done with the
  <dfn>Add Existing Media</dfn> dialog, accessed either by the
  <kbd class="menu"> Session &gt; Import</kbd> menu or, if any tracks have
  already been added, by right-clicking on the canvas of the <dfn>Editor</dfn>
  window and choosing <kbd class="menu">Insert Existing Media</kbd>.
</p>

<h2>The Soundfile Information Box</h2>
<p>
  This box will display information about the currently selected file:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>number of channels,</li>
  <li>sample rate,</li>
  <li>file format,</li>
  <li>length,</li>
  <li>embedded timestamp (applies to some professional formats such as
  Broadcast WAVE), and</li>
  <li><a href="@@searching-for-files-using-tags">tags</a> (attached metadata to help categorize files in a library).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If the sample rate differs from the current session rate, it is displayed
  in red, which indicates that the file must be resampled before
  importing.
</p>
<p>
  Resampling is controlled by the <kbd class="menu">Conversion quality</kbd>
  option described below.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h2>Auditioner</h2>
<p>
  Files can be auditioned before importing. The slider under the play and
  stop buttons allows to scrub around, a fader on the right side allows
  to control the playback volume.
</p>
<p>
  Auditioning MIDI files requires a MIDI instrument to be chosen in the <kbd class="menu">
  Instrument</kbd> dropdown list.
</p>

<h2>Importing options</h2>
<p>
  Through the <kbd class="menu">Add files&hellip;</kbd> option, imported files can be inserted in the session:
</p>
<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>as new tracks</th><td>automatically creates new tracks and import the files in it</td></tr>
  <tr><th>to region list</th><td>adds the files to the <a href="@@the-region-list">region list</a>, from where then can be manually dragged into a track</td></tr>
  <tr><th>as new tape tracks</th><td>adds the files as <a href="@@track-types">Tape tracks.</a></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
  The <kbd class="menu">Insert at</kbd> option chooses where in time the file will be imported, amongst:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the <dfn>file timestamp</dfn> (if available, zero by default)</li>
  <li>at the <a href="@@edit-point-control"><dfn>edit point</dfn></a></li>
  <li>at the <dfn>playhead</dfn></li>
  <li>at the <dfn>session start</dfn>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Channel <kbd class="menu">Mapping</kbd> option is only available for
  multi-channel files (i.e. all but mono ones). It is either
</p>
<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>one track/region per file</th><td>Creates a multi channel track for each imported file</td></tr>
  <tr><th>one track/region per channel</th><td>Creates only mono channels, as many as there are channels in the imported files</td></tr>
  <tr><th>sequence files</th><td>If multiple files are imported, they can be sequenced into a single track in the order of selection</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
  The <kbd class="menu">Conversion quality</kbd> drop-down controls the
  quality of the resampling process, if the sampling rate of the source file
  differs from the session rate.
</p>
<p>
  There are three MIDI-specific options as well. First off, you can set a track 
  naming scheme:
</p>
<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>by track number</th><td>will automatically assign every track a name that consists of the imported file name and a track number</td></tr>
  <tr><th>by track name</th><td>will</td></tr>
  <tr><th>by instrument name</th><td>will</a></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<p>
  You can also optionally import a tempo map from a MIDI file.
  The <kbd class="menu">Use MIDI Tempo Map (if defined)</kbd> option appears
  when a MIDI file is selected in the file selection dialog.
<p>
<p>
  The last MIDI-specific option is <kbd class="menu">Import MIDI Markers
  (if any)</kbd>. If those are present in a MIDI file, they will be rendered
  right above MIDI clips on the canvas. Editing the MIDI markers is currently
  unavailable.

</figure>
</p>
<p>
  Finally, and most importantly, the files can be linked or copied to the session
  with the <kbd class="option">Copy files to session</kbd> checkbox. Please read
  <a href="@@copying-versus-linking">Copying
  versus Linking</a> for details.
