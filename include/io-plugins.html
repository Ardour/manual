  I/O plugins provide an way to do pre- and post-processing outside the normal
  session. Pre-plugins run before Ardour does any processing, post-plugins run
  after Ardour has done all processing. The rationale is to provide a relatively
  lightweight pre-/post-processing workflow as compared to using busses.
</p>

<p>
  A common use case is wet recording where a number of plugins are applied
  directly to the physical input. The processed signal then can be routed to any
  number of tracks or busses in Ardour. This is a lot like doing some of the
  processing with a chain of guitar pedals, then feeding the signal to an Aux In
  port on a mixing console or an input port on a multi-effects digital
  pedalboard.

<h2>Adding I/O plugins</h2>

<p>
  New I/O plugins can be added in the <kbd class="title">I/O Plugins</kbd>
  dialog (<kbd class="menu">Window &gt; I/O Plugins</kbd>).

<p>
  Right-clicking opens the same menu for plugin selection available for mixer
  channel strips:

<p>
  Double-clicking opens the <kbd class="title">Plugin Selector</kbd> dialog.
</p>

<p>
  Once a plugin has been selected and added, it shows in either Pre- or
  Post-process section depending on your choice.

<h2>Routing I/O plugins</h2>

<p>
  I/O plugins have the same user interface for setting input and outputs that is
  also available in mixer channel strips. The button above the plugin name opens
  a drop-down menu for quickly choosing an input port. The button below opens
  the drop-down menu for choosing the output port.

<p>
  Additionally, new tracks automatically connected to an I/O plugin can be
  easily created in the <kbd class="title">Recorder</kbd> window by clicking the
  <kbd class="key">+</kbd> button and then setting a new for that track.
