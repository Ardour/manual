  The <dfn>Main Menu</dfn> allows the user to interact with Ardour and may
  appear daunting at first. Below is a reference of all the menus and submenus.
</p>

<p class="note">
  Most of these menus, and probably all of the most used 
  ones, have keyboard shortcuts to make using them easier and faster. A 
  summary of these shortcuts can be found on the <a 
  href="@@default-shortcuts">Defaults Keyboard Bindings</a> 
  page, and every menu in Ardour can be reassigned to an user defined 
  key binding, or used via <a 
  href="@@controlling-ardour-with-osc">OSC</a> with a control surface.
</p>

<p>
  Some menu items placement may depend on the OS, e.g. the "About" 
  window may not be in the <kbd class="menu">Help</kbd> menu on Mac 
  systems.
