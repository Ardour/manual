<p>
  The <dfn>Main Menu</dfn> is made of 8 menus that allow the user to interact with Ardour, and below is a reference of all the menu actions.
</p>

<p>
  Notice that a lot of these menus, and probably all of the most used ones, have keyboard shortcuts to make using them easier and faster.
  A summary of these shortcuts can be found on the <a href="@@default-keyboard-bindings">Defaults Keyboard Bindings</a> page, and
  every menu in Ardour can be reassigned to an user defined key binding, or used via <a href="@@controlling-ardour-with-osc">OSC</a> with
  a control surface.
