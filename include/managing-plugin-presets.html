  
<p>
  All plugin control widgets, whether they are created by Ardour or 
  by the plugin, have a common set of controls at the top of the window. 
  These include 4 controls for managing <dfn>plugin presets</dfn>.
</p>

<h2>What Is a Plugin Preset?</h2>
<p>
  A <dfn>preset</dfn> for a plugin is simply a saved set of values for 
  all of a plugin's parameters. If you load a preset, you are restoring 
  all the parameters of that plugin to the values stored in the preset. 
  This is an easy, fast way to manage your preferred settings for 
  particular plugins.
</p>

<h2>The Preset Selector</h2>
<p>
  The <dfn>preset selector</dfn> is a regular selector that can be 
  clicked to display a list of all known presets for this plugin. This 
  will include presets that you have created yourself, and for some 
  plugin formats, presets that come with the plugin itself. 
</p>

<h2>Load a New Preset</h2>
<p>
  Click on the preset selector to pop up a menu showing the names of 
  all available presets. Click on the name of the preset you wish to load. 
  The preset will be loaded &mdash; you may see various controls in the 
  plugin editor change to reflect the new value of some or all parameters.
</p>

<h2>Create a Preset</h2>
<p>
  To save the current plugin settings as a new preset, click on the 
  <kbd class="menu">Add</kbd> button at the top of the window. A dialog 
  will appear to ask for the name of the preset. 
</p>

<h2>Save a Preset</h2>
<p>
  If you wish to modify the settings in an existing preset, first use 
  the preset selector to load the preset, then adjust the settings as 
  you wish. When done, click the <kbd class="menu">Save</kbd> button 
  and the new values will be stored, overwriting the previous version 
  of this preset.
</p>

<h2>Delete a preset</h2>
<p>
  To delete an existing preset, use the preset selector to load the preset. 
  Click the <kbd class="menu">Delete</kbd> button, and the preset will be 
  removed. The preset selector turn blank, showing that no preset is 
  currently loaded (although the settings will stay as they were).
