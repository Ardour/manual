  <kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd>-clicking a marker in the timeline opens the
  marker context menu. From this menu, you can:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Locate to Here</dt>
  <dd>Move the playhead to this marker's position.</dd>
  <dt>Play from Here</dt>
  <dd>start playback from this marker's position.</dd>

  <dd>Create a range marker between this location and the next one along on
  the timeline.</dd>
  <dt>Hide</dt>
  <dd>Hide this marker from the view. It can be made visible again from the
  <kbd class="menu">Window &gt; Locations</kbd> window or the <a
  href="/ardours-interface/editor-lists/ranges-and-marks-list/">Ranges &amp; Marks
  list</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Rename</dt>
  <dd>Change the name of the marker.</dd>
  <dt>Lock</dt>
  <dd>If this is ticked, it will be impossible to drag the marker's
  position; useful if you want to prevent accidental movements.</dd>

  <dd>If this is ticked, the marker will maintain its position in bars and
  beats even if there are changes in tempo and meter.</dd>
  <dt>Remove</dt>
  <dd>Removes the marker. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
  There are also a few options in <kbd class="menu">Transport &gt; Active
  Mark</kbd>. These options apply to the currently selected location marker,
  and move it to a nearby region boundary, region sync point, or to the
  playhead or mouse.
