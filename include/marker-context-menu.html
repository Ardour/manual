<p>
  <kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd>-clicking a marker in the timeline opens the
  marker context menu:
</p>
<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>Locate to Here</th>
  <td>Move the playhead to this marker's position.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Play from Here</th>
  <td>start playback from this marker's position.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Move Mark to Playhead</th>
  <td>Move this marker to the current playhead position.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Create Range to Next Marker</th>
  <td>Create a range marker between this location and the next one along on
  the timeline.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Hide</th>
  <td>Hide this marker from the view. It can be made visible again from the
  <kbd class="menu">Window &gt; Locations</kbd> window or the <a
  href="@@the-ranges-and-marks-lists">Ranges &amp; Marks
  list</a>.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Rename</th>
  <td>Change the name of the marker.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Lock</th>
  <td>If this is ticked, it will be impossible to drag the marker's
  position; useful if you want to prevent accidental movements.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Remove</th>
  <td>Removes the marker. </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
  There are also a few options in <kbd class="menu">Transport &gt; Active
  Mark</kbd>. These options apply to the currently selected location marker,
  and move it to a nearby region boundary, region sync point, or to the
  playhead or mouse.
