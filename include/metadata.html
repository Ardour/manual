<p>
  Sessions can have various items of metadata attached to them, and saved in the
  session file. These metadata are filled by the user via
  <kbd class ="menu">Session &gt; Metadata &gt; Edit Metadata&hellip;</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
	These metadata will be exported as tags in the audio and video files that
	support it, as long as the right option is chosen at the
	<a href="@@export-dialog">export</a> stage. All the video format can retain a
	subset of the metadata if the <kbd class="option">Include Session Metadata</kbd>
	is checked in the <a href="@@workflow-amp-operations#export">export video</a>
	window, while only the Ogg-Vorbis (tagged) and FLAC (tagged)
	audio format will be exported with the metadata (as Vorbis comment).
</p>
<p>
	Ardour can also reuse the metadata from another session file in the current
	session, with <kbd class ="menu">Session &gt; Metadata &gt; Import Metadata&hellip;</kbd>.
	This menu brings up a file selector, asking for the source ardour session file
	to extract the data from. This can be handy when reusing a lot of information
	(Author, Artist Name, etc&hellip;) or working on multiple tracks of the same
	media.
