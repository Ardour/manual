	Meterbridge is a compact view of all meters in a session. It is designed
	to assist for large recording sessions, particularly live recording where
	the amount of mics is too large to get a good overview of the entire session
	in either the <kbd class="window">Mixer</kbd> or the
	<kbd class="window">Recorder</kbd> window.

<p>
	By default, the Meterbridge window displays a meter per each track with
	the track's name at the bottom and allows resetting the meter's peak
	as well as arm a track for recording.
</p>

<p>
	Each meter has a right-click menu to select the type of the meter.
	Just like in the mixer channel view, tracks and regular audio busses default
	to <kbd class="option">Peak (+6&nbsp;dBFS)</kbd> and the master bus defaults
	to <kbd class="option">K14 (RMS)</kbd>. It's also possible to set the same
	meter type to all same-type tracks.
</p>	
<p>
	Additionally, it's possible to select the height of the track name panel
	by right-clicking above it and selecting one of the options going from
	Short to Venti (which is a coffee cup size reference).
</p>

<p>
	Just like in the usual mixer channel view,
	the <kbd class="button">Arm for Recording</kbd> button has a right-click
	menu to enable rec-safe mode to avoid accidental recording to a track
	of choice.
</p>

<p>
	The set of readily available controls can be customized per each session
	on the <kbd class="window">Meterbridge</kbd> page of the
	<kbd class="window">Session Properties</kbd> dialog.
</p>

<p>
	Additional controls include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mute button</li>
	<li>Solo button</li>
	<li>Monitor buttons</li>
	<li>Fader as a gain knob</li>
</ul>

<p>
	It's also possible to toggle visibility of MIDI tracks, busses,
	and the master bus.
