<p>
  The <dfn>List Editor</dfn> is a way to look at the MIDI data of a region, not
  graphically as they are displayed in the Editor, but in a tabular form.
  This way of seeing the MIDI data allows for quicker "debugging" of a MIDI
  region, and for fast <em>non-graphical</em> (i.e. no mouse involved)
  editing. The list has a vertical flow, i.e. the first events (in time) are
  at the top of the window, and the last are at the bottom.
</p>

<p>
  It is accessed by selecting the <kbd class="menu">Region &gt; MIDI &gt; List
  Editor&hellip;</kbd> menu while having one MIDI region selected, or by <kbd
  class="mouse">Right</kbd> clicking the MIDI region and choosing <kbd
  class="menu"><em>Name_Of_The_Region</em> &gt; MIDI &gt; List
  Editor&hellip;</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
  The window displays the following MIDI data:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>Start</th><td>the timestamp of the start of the note</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Channel</th><td>the MIDI channel of the event</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Num</th><td>The <a href="@@midi-notes-ref">MIDI number</a> of the note</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Name</th><td>The MIDI name of the note, made of its English name and octave (e.g. "C4")</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Vel</th><td>the velocity of the note, i.e. its volume, between 0 (silent) and 127 (full)</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Length</th><td>duration of the note, either expressed as a number (in ticks, related to the tempo) or as a text
  (fraction of a beat, also related to the tempo)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  At the top of the window is a <kbd class="menu">Sound Selected MIDI
  Notes</kbd> button, which toggles playing a note as it is selected.
</p>

<p>
  Each value can be manually modified, by <kbd class="mouse">left</kbd>
  clicking it. However, the <em>Name</em> field is derived from the
  <em>Number</em> field, and cannot be edited. To change a note, its number
  must be changed, which will be reflected in the <em>Name</em> field.
