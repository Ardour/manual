<!-- <p>
	There are several ways to edit velocity of MIDI notes in Ardour:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>by selecting notes on the timeline and scrolling the mouse wheel;</li>
	<li>by editing lollipop-shaped velocity markers in a dedicated
		<strong>Velocity</strong> automation lane;</li>
	<li>by setting the exact value of a note in its properties dialog or
		in the <strong>List Editor</strong> for the entire MIDI region;</li>
	<li>by using the <strong>Transform</strong> dialog for selected notes.</li>
</ul> -->

<h2>Velocity lane</h2>

<p>
	To open the velocity lane, right-click on the MIDI track header and select
	<kbd class="menu">Automation &gt; Velocity</kbd>.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
	Each notes's velocity is represented as a lollipop-shaped object.
	Each lollipop object has two characteristics that represent the velocity
	value:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		The vertical position: the lower the lollipop head is, the lower is the
		velocity value, and vice versa.
	</li>
	<li>
		The color: just like with notes on the timeline, it goes from pale yellow
		(low velocity) to bright red (high velocity).
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Editing single notes</h2>

<p>
	To edit a single note's velocity <em>on the timeline</em>, click to select
	the note in either Draw or Edit mode, then scroll the mouse wheel up or
	down. The new value will be displayed in an overlay.

<p>
	To edit a single note'velocity <em>on the velocity lane</em>, switch to the
	Edit mode, grab the note's velocity lollipop, then drag it up or down:

<p>
	To edit a single note in a chord <em>on the velocity lane</em>, switch to the
	Edit mode, select the note in the timeline, then draw its velocity lollipop up
	or down:

<h2>Editing multiple notes</h2>

<p>
	To edit velocities of multiple notes <em>on the timeline</em>, in the Edit
	mode, do a rubberband selection to select adjacent notes or press
	<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to select non-adjacent notes (<kbd>Shift</kbd> will select
	entire chords), then hover one of the selected notes and rotate the mouse
	wheel up or down. Velocities will be adjusted in all selected notes
	relatively, i.e. by the same amount.

<p>
	It's also possibly to edit the velocity of multiple notes in a MIDI region
	by drawing free or straight lines in the velocity lane.
</p>

<p>
	To draw a free line, in Draw mode, click and draw the mouse pointer over the
	velocity lane from left to right:
</p>

<p>
	To draw a straight line, in Draw mode, press and hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, then
	click and drag the mouse pointer to draw a straight line. Once you get the
	line you expected, release the mouse button and then the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key.
</p>

<p>
	Just like with automation lines, you can also combine free and straight lines
	in one go. Draw a free line, then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to draw straight line,
	release the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key, continue drawing free lines, release the mouse
	button when you are'done drawing.
</p>

<p>
	When multiple notes are selected on the pianoroll, free and straight lines
	in the velocity lane will only affect selected notes.
