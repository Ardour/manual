<p>
  The mini-timeline allows, as the
  <a href="@@summary">Summary</a> does, navigation of a
  session. Its main advantage, though, is that it stays visible even when in
  Mixer mode.
</p>

<p>
  The range of time covered by the mini-timeline is set by <kbd
  class=mouse>right</kbd> clicking the timeline, and choosing a time span
  from 30 seconds up to 20 minutes.
</p>

<p>
  The mini-timeline also shows all markers (start, end and any user
  defined ones). Clicking a marker jumps to that point on the timeline,
  allowing for quick access to key timings in the session.
</p>

<p>
  While hovering with the mouse over the mini-timeline:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><kbd class=mouse>left</kbd> clicking moves the playhead to the time under the mouse cursor</li>
  <li>using the <kbd class=mouse>scroll wheel</kbd> scrolls the playhead back and forth inside the session</li>
  <li>using <kbd class=mod1n></kbd><kbd class=mouse>scroll wheel</kbd> scrolls more finely inside the session</li>
  <li>using <kbd class=mod12n></kbd><kbd class=mouse>scroll wheel</kbd> scrolls even more finely inside the session</li>
</ul>
