<p>
  The mini-timeline allows, as the <a href="@@summary">Summary</a> 
  does, navigating a session. Its main advantage, though, is that it 
  stays visible even when in Mixer mode.
</p>

<p>
  The range of time covered by the mini-timeline is set by <kbd
  class=mouse>right</kbd> clicking the timeline, and choosing a time span
  from 30 seconds up to 20 minutes.
</p>

<p>
  The mini-timeline shows all markers (<em>start</em>, <em>end</em> and 
  any user defined ones). Clicking a marker jumps to that point on the 
  timeline, allowing for quick access to key timings in the session. 
  The next and previous markers out of the mini-timeline range are 
  indicated by arrows, as the <em>end</em> marker in the screenshot 
  above.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="@@mixing-linear-nonlinear-workflows">Cue markers</a> are 
  also displayed, with their play time duration shown by a line.
</p>

<p>
  While hovering with the mouse over the mini-timeline:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><kbd class="mouse">left</kbd> clicking moves the playhead to the time under the mouse cursor</li>
  <li>using the <kbd class="mouse">scroll wheel</kbd> scrolls the playhead back and forth inside the session</li>
  <li>using <kbd class="mod1"></kbd><kbd class="mouse">scroll wheel</kbd> scrolls more finely inside the session</li>
  <li>using <kbd class="mod1"></kbd><kbd class="mod2"></kbd><kbd class="mouse">scroll wheel</kbd> scrolls even more finely inside the session</li>
</ul>
