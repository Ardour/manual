<p>
	<dfn>Mixer Scenes</dfn> are a convenient way to keep multiple variations
	of a mix with the same set of tracks, busses, and plugins. In a recording
	studio environment, you can use it to quickly navigate between versions
	of a mix. In a broadcasting situation, it's a convenient way
	to quickly "add" a new mic when another guest joins a conversation.
</p>

<p>
	The user interface is located in the bottom left part of the <dfn>Mixer</dfn>
	window. Scenes are numbered as 1 through 8 and have title to the right
	of the numbers.

<p>
	You can store a new mixer scene, recall it, overwrite it, rename it,
	or clear it. All interactions involve right-clicking, middle-clicking,
	or left-clicking a button with a number that represents a scene.
</p>

<h2>What mixer scenes can and cannot do</h2>

<p>
	As part of a mixer scene, you can store and recall only the controls
	that you can automate:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fader position in tracks, all types of busses, and VCA masters</li>
	<li>Panner position in tracks and all types of busses</li>
	<li>Foldback bus output levels</li>
	<li>State of record arm</li>
	<li>State of monitor input and monitor playback</li>
	<li>State of solo and mute</li>
	<li>Settings of plugins</li>
</ul>

<p>Mixer scenes do not cover:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The general signal chain in the processor box, i.e. which plugins
	are loaded in whatever order</li>
	<li>Plugin bypass states</li>
	<li>Comments for mixer channels</li>
	<li>Any monitor section controls <a href="#footnote-1" class="footnote">&dagger;</a> (since 8.6-318-gb50477e608)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Storing a mixer scene</h2>

<p>
	All mixer scenes are enumerated in the user interface. Hover the mouse
	pointer over an unused scene slot, right-click, then select
	<kbd class="menu">Store</kbd>.
</p>

<figure class="right">
  <img class="mini" style="width:300px;" src="/images/mixer-scene-store.png" alt="Store a new mixer scene">

</figure>

<p>
	When you create a new mixer scene, the name defaults to the timestamp of
	the moment you are creating this scene. Instead, you can give scenes
	meaningful names. That way you can reopen a session months later and
	be able to tell which scene corresponds to which variation of the mix.
</p>

<h2>Recalling a mixer scene</h2>

<p>
	To switch to an existing mixer scene (i.e. to recall it), simply left-click
	on the button with the scene number.
</p>

<p>
	It's possible to recall a mixer scene only for a selection of tracks/busses.
	Select tracks or busses of interest by pressing <kbd class="mod3n"></kbd>
	and then clicking inside respective processor boxes, then right-click the
	mixer-scenes recall button for a context menu and choose the
	<kbd class="menu">Restore for selected tracks</kbd> menu item.
</p>

<p class="note">
	When restoring a mixer scene, any control that is in automation Write or
	Touch mode will not be restored.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to quickly compare the current scene against a different one,
	hover the numbered button of the other scene, middle-click it and hold.
	Release the mouse button when you're done comparing.
</p>

<h2>Renaming a mixer scene</h2>

<p>
	You can rename a scene at any time later. Right-click over the button with
	scene's number, choose <kbd class="menu">Rename</kbd>, the enter a new name
	in the newly opened dialog.
</p>

  <img class="mini" style="width:300px;" src="/images/mixer-scene-rename.png" alt="Rename a mixer scene">

</figure>

<h2>Clearing a mixer scene</h2>

<p>
	If you don't need a scene anymore or if you want to reserve it for something
	else in the future, you can clear it. Right-click over the button with scene's
	number, and choose <kbd class="menu">Clear</kbd>. This will empty the scene slot.
</p>

<p>
	If the scene you've just cleared was the one currently loaded, all positions
	of faders, panners etc. will remain intact. You can continue making further
	adjustments.
</p>

<h2>Overwriting a stored scene</h2>

<p>
	If you made some adjustments and want them to be saved into an existing scene,
	simply choose <kbd class="menu">Store</kbd> in the right-click menu for that
	scene. Ardour will ask your confirmation for overwriting it and will suggest
	renaming the scene (clicking the <kbd class="button">Store</kbd> button without
	changing the name will effectively keep the old name).
</p>

<h2>Accessing more mixer scenes</h2>

<p>
	Ardour only exposes 8 mixer scenes in the user interface for simplicity's
	sake. However the actual number of scenes is larger. There are two ways
	to work around that and store, recall, and clear more mixer scenes:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Keyboard shortcuts: Ardour already defaults to Ctrl+F1..F12 for storing
		mixer scenes and to F1..F12 for recalling them, which gives you 4 more
		scenes that are, however, not visible in the list. You can also manually
		assign any keyboard shortcuts
		(<kbd class="menu">Window &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts</kbd>) to mixer scene actions.
	</li>
	<li>
		Scripting: you can use <a href="@@lua-scripting">Lua scripts</a> to access
		the full range of available mixer scenes, which is 2<sup>64</sup>.
	</li>
</ol>

<p id="footnote-1">&dagger; Until Ardour 8.6.318 monitor output level was saved with mixer scenes.</p>
