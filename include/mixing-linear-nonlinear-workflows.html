	You can combine the linear workflow, i.e. working with regions on the
	timeline, and the non-linear workflow, i.e. launching clips from trigger

<li>Add cue markers.</li>
<li>Add the "stop all cues" marker</li>
<li>Draw/record your non-repeatable regions the usual way on the timeline/canvas.</li>
</ol>
