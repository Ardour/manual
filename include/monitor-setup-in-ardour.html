<p>
  Ardour has two main settings which affect how monitoring is performed.
  The first is <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Monitoring &gt;
  Record monitoring handled by</kbd>. There are two or three options here,
  depending on the capabilities of the hardware.
</p>
<p>
  The other setting is the <kbd class="option">Session &gt; Properties &gt;
  Track Input Monitoring automatically follows transport state
  (auto-input)</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
  Monitoring also depends on the state of the track's record-enable button
  and the session record-enable button, as well as on whether or not the
  transport is rolling.
</p>

<p>
  If Ardour is set to <dfn>external monitoring</dfn>, Ardour does not do any
  monitoring.
