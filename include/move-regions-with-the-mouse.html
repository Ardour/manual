<p>
  Moving or copying a region is done using the <a href="@@toolbox">Grab mouse mode</a>,
  or the Smart mode with the pointer in the lower half of the region
  to begin a move or <a href="@@copy-regions">copy</a> operation.
</p>
<p>
  With the pointer in the region, using a <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd>-drag will
  make the region follow the pointer as it is moved around. By default,
  the region can move freely along the timeline.
</p>
<p>
  To move a region from one track to another, the move must be started as
  described above, but the pointer should end in the desired track. The
  region will follow the pointer.
</p>
<p class="note">
  if some other kinds of tracks are visible, the region will remain where it is
  as the pointer moves across them, and will then jump to the new track. This
  serves as a visual reminder that an audio region cannot be dragged into an automation
  track or a bus, for example.
</p>

<h2>Move Multiple Regions</h2>
<p>
  In order to move multiple regions, they should be selected before moving. Then
  <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd>-dragging one of the selected regions will move
  all the regions, keeping their positions relative to each other.
</p>

<h2>Fixed-Time Motion</h2>
<p>
  Moving region(s) to other track(s) while keeping them at the
  same exact position on the timeline is done by simply using a
  <kbd class="mouse">Middle</kbd>-drag instead.
</p>

<p>
  On macOS, where the middle click might not be available, the same effect
  can be achieved by switching to the <a href="@@toolbox">Lock mode</a>
  (as opposed to Slide or Ripple) in the top-left area of the screen.
