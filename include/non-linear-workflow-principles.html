<p>
	The Cue window allows working with music ideas in a non-linear fashion.
	Instead of navigating the timeline and placing regions of audio and MIDI
	data at a particular point in time, short clips that contain
	rhythmic and melodic patterns can be triggered to play a certain amount
	of times, then automatically trigger another clip to be played.
</p>

<p>
	The concept has been introduced and popularized by Ableton and since then
	found its way into many other applications. Ardour draws many ideas from
	Ableton Live, as well as from several other digital audio workstations,
	and adapts them to Ardour's specifics. Someone familiar with Live
	will find many aspects to be similar, but the Cue's feature
	set is not a 100% copy of that from any other application.
</p>

<p>
	Here are some basics concepts of the non-linear workflow shared by multiple
	applications including Ardour.
</p>

<h2>Grid and scenes</h2>

<p>
	All clips are organized in a kind of a grid. The grid provides an overview
	of all the musical ideas, all the rhythmic patterns, short melodies, and sound
	effects that can be used in a composition.
</p>
<p>
	One dimension of the grid, usually represented by a track, would accumulate
	clips played with roughly the same kind of an instrument, e.g. all drum
	patterns, or all basslines etc.
</p>
<p>
	The other dimension, usually called scenes (or cues, in Ardour) would
	organize these clips so that it is possible to play multiple clips at
	the same time by pressing just one button. So if one wants a particular
	bassline played along a particular drum sequence, they should be placed in
	the same scene.
</p>

<p>
	Ardour specifics are explained in the
	<a href="@@cue-window-elements">Cue window elements</a> chapter.
</p>

<h2>Slots and clips</h2>

<p>
	Cells in a grid are usually called slots. They are a kind of a container
	that can hold an audio or a MIDI clip. Typically, a clip can be loaded
	into a slot from a disk by pointing the file selector to it, or loaded
	from a pre-recorded library of reusable clips, or recorded in place.
	More information about that cqan be found in the
	<a href="@@populating-the-cue-grid">Populating the cue grid</a> chapter.
</p>

<h2>Launching</h2>

<p>
	In a non-linear workflow, a clip can be triggered to play in multiple ways.
	Most of the time it's either pressing a corresponding silicon pad on an
	external grid controller attached via MIDI, or scrolling the mouse wheel
	downwards over the slot that contains the clip, or just clicking a 'Play'
	button next to clip's name.
</p>

<p>
	Usually, a slot can be configured to respond to some ways to trigger clip
	playback and ignore others. This is discussed in depth in the
	<a href="@@clip-launch-options">Clip Launch Options</a> chapter.
</p>

<h2>Follow actions</h2>

<p>
	A clip can play in a loop until stopped directly, or it can play
	a user-defined amount of time and then trigger another clip in the track.
	As an example, a composition can start with one rhythmic pattern played four times
	and the next rhythmic patterns is played eight times, then a third one is started.
</p>

<p>
	This is typically achieved through so called follow actions. In an example
	above, for the first clip (or, rather, slot), a follow count must be set
	(4 times), and the follow action usually called "Next" is used. This will get
	the clip in that first slot to play 4 times then trigger the playback of
	a clip in the second slot.
</p>

<p>
	Every application has its own set of follow actions. Most common ones are
	repeating the clip indefinitely, triggering the previous/next slot,
	or jumping to a slot in a particular scene.
</p>

</p>

<h2>Musical time and stretching</h2>

<p>
	In a non-linear workflow, all work is happening in musical time: both audio
	and MIDI clips are measured in bars and beats.
</p>

<p>
	By default, an application that supports a non-linear workflow will attempt
	to estimate beats per minute in an audio clip and then stretch or squeeze
	the clip so that it would match the bpm of the session and wrap neatly around
	bars. That way, a clip that originally has a different tempo that the one in
	the session would stay in sync with other clips.
