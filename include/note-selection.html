<h2>Navigating/Selecting notes with the keyboard</h2>

<p>
  <kbd>tab</kbd> selects the next note in a MIDI region, while <kbd
  class="mod1">tab</kbd> selects the previous note. Holding down the <kbd
  class="mod3"></kbd> key as well prevents previously visited notes from being
  deselected.
</p>

<h2>Selecting notes with the mouse</h2>

<p>
  While in <a href="@@toolbox">Object Mode</a>, any note can be clicked on to select it. Once a note has been selected, <kbd class="mouse mod3">left</kbd>-clicking on another note selects all notes between the first note selected and the second one. Adding or removing a note to or from the selection is done by <kbd class="mouse mod1">left</kbd>-clicking it. Clicking and dragging outside of a note will <dfn>rubberband select</dfn> any notes enclosed by the selection rectangle; holding down the <kbd class="mod3n"></kbd> key will prevent any previously selected notes from being deselected.
</p>

<p>
  In any mode, <kbd class="mod3 mouse">left</kbd>-clicking on a note on the
  Scroomer (the piano header of the track, see <a
  href="@@midi-track-controls">MIDI Track Controls</a>) will add all
  occurrences of that note to the selection, while <kbd
  class="mouse">middle</kbd>-clicking will only select/deselect all occurances
  of that note, clearing the previous selection. Scroomer selections work on
  all MIDI regions of a track at once.
</p>

<h2>Listening to Selected Notes</h2>

<p>
  If <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; MIDI &gt; Sound MIDI notes as
  they are selected</kbd> is enabled, Ardour will send a pair of NoteOn/NoteOff
  messages through the track as notes are selected. Assuming there is an
  appropriate device or synthesizer attached to the track, these should be
  audible.
