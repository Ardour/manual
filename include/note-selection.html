<h2>Selecting/Navigating note-by-note</h2>
<p>
  <kbd>Tab</kbd> selects the next note. <kbd class="mod1">Tab</kbd> selects the previous
  note. <kbd class="mod3">Tab</kbd> or <kbd class="mod13">Tab</kbd> adds
  the next/previous note to the selection.
</p>

<h2>Selecting notes with the mouse</h2>
<p>
  While in mouse object mode, any note can be clicked to select it. Once a note
  has been selected, <kbd class="mouse mod3">Left</kbd>-clicking on another
  selects all notes between them. Adding or removing a note to/from the
  selection is done by <kbd class="mouse mod1">Left</kbd> clicking it. Clicking and
  dragging outside of a note <dfn>rubberband selects</dfn> a series of notes.
</p>
<p>
  Three different selection operations are possible while in mouse range mode:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Vertical drags within the MIDI region will select all notes within the
    spanned note range.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clicks on the piano header of the track (if visible&mdash;the track must
    be tall enough to display it) will select all occurrences of that note.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drags on the piano header of the track will select all notes within the
    spanned note range.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Listening to Selected Notes</h2>
<p>
  If <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; MIDI &gt; Sound MIDI notes
  as they are selected</kbd> is enabled, Ardour will send a pair of
  NoteOn/NoteOff messages through the track, which will typically allow to
  hear each note as it is selected.
