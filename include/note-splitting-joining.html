	It is possible to evenly split (tuple) and join notes in both the
	<strong>Draw</strong> and the <strong>Internal Edit</strong> modes.
</p>

<h2>Splitting notes</h2>

<p>
	To split a note or a group of notes into tuplets, first select the notes.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Press <kbd class="button">S</kbd> to split selected notes into two tuplets.
	In the example below, each note with a duration of two whole notes will be
	split into two notes, each with a duration of one whole note. For each
	newly created note, Ardour will display its velocity inherited from the
	original notes.
</p>

</figure>
</p>

<p>
	Repeatedly pressing <kbd class="button">S</kbd> will increment the amount
	of tuplets. Thus, the next key press will divide the original note into
	3 notes 2 and 2/3 beats long each, then 4 notes 2 beats long each etc.
	Ardour will display a temporary message at the bottom of the MIDI region
	to tell how many subdivisions have been created.

</p>

<p>
	To stop incrementing the amount of subdivisions, deselect notes by
	clicking elsewhere in the MIDI region or by pressing
	<kbd class="button">Esc</kbd>.
</p>

<h2>Joining notes</h2>

<p>
	To join several notes into one, select the notes, then press
	<kbd class="button">J</kbd>:
</p>

</p>

<p>
	If non-adjacent notes are selected, and there is a blank space between
	them, the note will extend from the beginning of the earliest note to
	the end of the latest note and fill the blank spaces with itself:

	If non-adjacent notes are selected, and there is at least one note between
	them, newly created note will overlay the existing note:
