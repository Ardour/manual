<p>
  The <dfn>nudge controls</dfn> will move the selected region(s) or notes
  in MIDI regions by a fixed amount of time. The left and right buttons move
  either backward or forward in time, and the small clock to the right of
  these buttons sets the amount of time to nudge by.
</p>

<p>
  The clock, as with all other clocks, can be <kbd 
  class="mouse">right</kbd>-clicked on to choose the desired <a 
  href="@@editing-clocks">time representation</a>. The menu also allows :
</p>

<ul>
	<li><dfn>Set from Playhead</dfn> : the clock is the current position of the playhead</li>
	<li><dfn>Locate to this time</dfn> : moves the playhead to the the clock time</li>
	<li><dfn>Copy to clipboard</dfn> : copies the clock (with formatting) to the clipboard.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Combining these three options allow to e.g. memorize the current 
  playhead position (<em>Set from playhead</em>) and reposition the 
  playhead (<em>Locate to this time</em>) at that position after 
  another edit.
</p>

<p>
  If there are no selected objects, the nudge controls can be used to 
  move the playhead backward or forward by the amount shown on the 
  clock.
