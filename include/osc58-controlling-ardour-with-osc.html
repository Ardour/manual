<p>
  <abbr title="Open Sound Control"><dfn>OSC</dfn></abbr> lets synthesizers
  and other devices communicate with Ardour. OSC devices can send commands
  relating to playback (such as play or stop), performance (such as volume,
  play, stop, and almost any other function (such as Edit, or Undo).
</p>

<p class="note">
  <em>Note:</em> OSC control has changed dramatically since Ardour 4.7.
  The Path structure has been completely redone, Banking has been introduced,
  The controller is now able to tell Ardour what kind of feedback it can
  work with (including bank size) and the gain controls have new math
  calculations. If you are using an Ardour version of 4.7 or less,
  please read <a

  Ardour is probably one of the most OSC-controllable audio applications
  around, but as with all OSC-controllable apps, you can't do much without
  knowing what <dfn>messages</dfn> can be sent. This document describes the
  various categories of messages that Ardour understands. It is subject to
  change, particularly the "Actions" part below, since this relates to the
  GTK GUI for Ardour rather than the backend.
</p>

<h2>Connecting to Ardour via OSC</h2>
<p>
  OSC support is not enabled by default, but can be turned on via
  <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Control Surfaces</kbd>.
  Once enabled, Ardour will listen on port <code>3819</code> by default.
  This port number can be changed by editing <code>$ARDOUR_CONFIG</code>
  and adding this line within the <code>&lt;Config&gt;</code> section:
</p>
<kbd class="input">&lt;Option name="osc-port" value="<em>Your choice
here</em>"/&gt;</kbd>

<p>
  Ardour sends any feedback to the port and address that sent any
  feedback request or to a port set manually in the setup dialog.
  The port does not have to match Ardour's port. In
  fact it is better not to. This means that Ardour can deal with more
  than one controller at a time. The two controllers can bank
  independently and even use different math for faders. This could be
  used to allow talent to adjust their own monitor mix using a tablet
  or phone that can run an OSC controller. For a full explanation of
  how Ardour's feedback works please read <a
  href="@@osc58-feedback">
  OSC feedback In Ardour.</a>
</p>

<h2 id="set-up">Control Surface Set Up</h2>

<p>
  Control surface set up allows the controller to tell Ardour about its
  capabilities. The surface can tell Ardour how many control strips it
  has for banking, if it is capable of setting its faders or buttons
  to values set by Ardour's GUI or automation, What kind of math the
  faders use and more.
</p>
<p>
  Any time the <em>/set_surface</em> command is sent, the current bank
  is recalculated and if feedback is turned on, the values of each
  strip's controls are sent (or refreshed) as well. This will also
  refresh the Master feedback setup.
</p>
<p>
  As of Ardour 5.1, There is now a GUI setup in response to those using
  tablets with applications such as touchOSC or AndrOSC who need to be
  able to set a port for Ardour to send to. It can also change the
  default setting for set_surface. For more information about Ardour's
  OSC configuration GUI please read <a
  href="@@osc58-using-the-setup-dialog">
  Ardour's Setup Dialog.</a>
</p>
<p>If /set_surface is not sent, the default values are used:
  <ul>
	  <li><em>Bank Size</em>: 0 &mdash; No banking (or infinite bank size).</li>
	  <li><em>Strip Types</em>: 159 &mdash; All strip types except hidden and special.</li>
	  <li><em>Feedback</em>: 0 &mdash; All off.</li>
	  <li><em>Fader Mode</em>: 0 &mdash; gain in dB (not relevant with feedback off)</li>
	  <li><em>Send Page Size</em>: 0 &mdash; No Send Paging.</li>
	  <li><em>Plugin Page Size</em>: 0 &mdash; No Plugin Paging.</li>
	  <li><em>reply port</em>: 8000 &mdash; control surface will receive feedback on port 8000</li>
	  <li><em>Link set</em>: 0 &mdash; no linking for this control surface</li>
	  <li><em>Link ID</em>: 0 &mdash; no link ID</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  These values give the same behaviour as prior versions of Ardour. (or the closest possible)
</p>

  <kbd class="osc">/set_surface <em>bank_size</em> <em>strip_types</em>
  <em>feedback</em> <em>fadermode</em> <em>send_page_size</em>
  <em>plugin_page_size</em> <em>port</em> <em>linkset</em> <em>linkid</em></kbd>
<p>
	See below for an explanation of each parameter.
</p>
<p class="note">
	The /set_surface message may have all values except the last in-line.
	For example: <code>/set_surface/8/31/8403/0/8 i 16</code> would be valid.
	Do be careful of switches which send a 0 on release, it may be necessary
	to set the value as the release value rather than the press value.
</p>
<p class="note">
	The /set_surface message may have less than the full set of parameters.
	those left out will remain as they were before the /set_surface message was
	sent. All parameters included must be valid. For example, setting send page
	size would require also setting bank_size, strip_types, feedback and gain mode.
	using only two parameters will set bank_size and strip_types. Sending /set_surface with
	no parameters will result in Ardour returning a /set_surface message with the
	current settings. Surfaces using /set_surface iiii b st fb gm as was the case
	in versions of Ardour older than 5.10 will continue to work.
</p>
<h3>bank_size</h3>
<p>
  Bank Size is the number of channel strips the controller supports
  without banking. Setting this to 0 turns banking off by setting the
  bank size to infinite.
</p>
<p class="note">
	Bank size can also be set with <em>/set_surface/bank_size size.</em>
</p>
<h3>strip_types</h3>
<p>
  strip_types is an integer made up of bits. The easy way to
  deal with this is to think of strip_types items being worth a number and
  then adding all those numbers together for a value to send.
  Strip Types will determine what kind of strips will be included in
  bank. This would include: Audio, MIDI, busses, VCAs, Master, Monitor
  and hidden or selected strips.
</p>
<p>
  Aside from setting the track types for the main mix assignments, using
  /set_surface/strip_types with more than one surface button will allow
  switching between modes for example: inputs only, busses only,
  selected only, hidden only, by having the buttons send values of: 3,
  12, 256, 512. A full mix button might have a value 31.
</p>
<p>
  While Master and Monitor are listed as possibilities, most surfaces
  will not use them. Using /master and /monitor makes more sense.
  However, in the case where there are no master or monitor fader strips
  on the surface, it may be necessary to include them in the banked
  strips.
</p>
<p>Please see: <a
  href="@@osc58-feedback-and-strip-types-values">
  Calculating Feedback and Strip-types Values.</a>
</p>
<p class="note">
	Strip types can also be set with <em>/set_surface/strip_types types.</em>
</p>
<h3>feedback</h3>
<p>Feedback is an integer made up of bits. The easy way to
  deal with this is to think of feedback items being worth a number and
  then adding all those numbers together for a value to send.
</p>
<p>Please see: <a
  href="@@osc58-feedback-and-strip-types-values#feedback">
  Calculating Feedback and Strip-types Values.</a></p>
<p class="note">
	Feedback can also be set with <em>/set_surface/feedback feedback.</em>
</p>

<h3>gainmode</h3>
<p>
  Gainmode is an int:
  <ul>
	  <li><em>0:</em> dB value as a float from -193 to +6. Sent as
	  <kbd class="osc">/strip/gain SSID value</kbd>. (-193 or below are the same as -inf)</li>
	  <li><em>1:</em> A positional fader based on the same math
	  as Ardour's GUI.  A Float from 0 to 1. Sent as
	  <kbd class="osc">/strip/fader SSID value</kbd>. At the same time the
	  gain value in dB is sent to the channel name as text. The name
	  will be restored after a short timeout.</li>
	  <li><em>2:</em> A positional fader based on the same math
	  as Ardour's GUI.  A Float from 0 to 1. Sent as
	  <kbd class="osc">/strip/fader SSID value</kbd>. At the same time
	  the gain value in dB is sent as <kbd class="osc">/strip/gain SSID
	  value</kbd>.</li>
	  <li><em>3:</em> A positional fader based on the same math
	  as Ardour's GUI.  A Float from 0 to 1. Sent as
	  <kbd class="osc">/strip/fader SSID value</kbd>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Gainmode applies only to feedback values. The controller can choose
  which gain math to use by choosing to use the /*/gain or /*/fader path
  to send to Ardour. This makes sure a controller that doesn't set up
  Ardour's OSC can still use either math. The gainmode for feedback also
  determines the path Ardour uses for feedback so that the feedback
  messages match the control messages.
</p>
<p class="note">
	Gain mode can also be set with <em>/set_surface/gainmode gainmode.</em>
</p>
<h3>send_page_size</h3>
<p>
	Send_page_size is an int for the number of send channels that can be controlled
	at one time. Each channel has a name, level and enable control. (added in Ardour 5.10)
</p>
<p class="note">
	Send page size can also be set with <em>/set_surface/send_page_size send_page_size.</em>
</p>
<h3>plugin_page_size</h3>
<p>
	plugin_page_size is an int for the number of plugin controls that can be controlled
	at one time. Each control has a name and level. As each plugin is different (as is each
	parameter), the surface should expect to control the plugin parameters with a variable
	control (pot or slider) with a float value from 0 to 1 (even on/off switches). (added in
	Ardour 5.10)
</p>
<p class="note">
	Plugin page size can also be set with <em>/set_surface/plugin_page_size plugin_page_size.</em>
</p>
<h3>port</h3>
<p>
	The port the controller would like to receive it's feedback on. Starting
	with Ardour 6.0, the surface can directly set the manual port or set
	it's host to <code>auto</code> port mode.
</p>
<p>
	The value for <code>port</code> can be 0 for <code>auto</code> port mode or any
	port value above 1024. It is suggested not to use Ardour's port number
	of 3819 as controllers on the same machine that try to use the same
	port will fail.
</p>
<p>
	If the surface does not
	tell Ardour which port to use, the default is 8000 or the setting
	set up in the OSC setup GUI. There can only be one port setting per
	host. If that setting is <code>auto</code>, than more than one
	controller can be run on that host, but if a manual port is set there
	can only be one. In the case of <code>auto</code> mode, the control
	surface must set it's receive port to be the same as it's send port.
	If that is not possible, then manual port mode must be used. This
	allows a smart controller to use a number of ports on the same ip while
	a smartphone set up as a personal monitor control can use the default
	manual port.
</p>
<p class="note">
	The host's port can also be set with <em>/set_surface/port port.</em>
</p>
<p class="note">
	Changing the port will remove feedback from a device on the same host
	using a different port.
</p>
<h3>Link set and Link ID</h3>
<p>
	Please see <a href="@@osc58-linking-surfaces">Linking Surfaces</a>
	For more information.
</p>
<h2>Querying Ardour for information</h2>
<p>
  The control Surface may wish to control the type a frequency of
  updates it receives. It can do this with querying commands. See: <a
  href="@@osc58-querying-ardour">
  Querying Ardour with OSC.</a>
</p>
<h2>Using more than one surface</h2>
<p>
	Ardour can use more than one surface at a time that both control the
	same controls in Ardour. It is also possible to use two surfaces in
	concert with each other. See: <a
  href="@@osc58-linking-surfaces">
  Linking Surfaces</a> for more information.
</p>
<h2>List of OSC messages</h2>
<p class="note">
	Parameter types show how the value will be used. However, they may
	be sent as a different type if needed, see: <a
	href="@@osc58-parameter-types">

<h3 id="strips">Track specific operations</h3>
<p>
  For each of the following, <em>ssid</em> is the Surface Strip ID for the track
</p>
<p>
  As of Ardour 6.0, the user may use a subset all available strips. See:
  <a href="@@osc58-custom-strips">
  Making a user selected strip list.</a>
</p>
<p class="note">
  SSID has a different meaning than RID in Ardour version 4.7 and before.
  Effectively, banking is always being used and the SSID is generated on
  the fly. The SSID is the position of the strip within bank as an int
  1 to bank size. There are no gaps as there have been in the past.
  Depending on the value of strip_types sent to Ardour, Master and
  Monitor, may be included in the list of SSIDs or not as set in
  <em>/set_surface</em>.

  Some Surfaces (many Android applets) are not able to deal with more

<h3 id="select">Selected Strip Operations</h3>
<p>
  New for Ardour 5, A whole set of operations that work on the selected
  or expanded strip.
</p>
<p class="note">
  Selected strip operations are complex enough for their own page.
  Please read: <a
  href="@@osc58-selection-and-expansion-considerations">
  Selection Considerations in OSC.</a> This is most important if more
  than one OSC surface is being used with Ardour.
</p>
<p>
  There are two kinds of selection in OSC. GUI selection and local
  expansion. By default expansion follows selection.
  <ul>
	<li>
		GUI selection: Use <em>/strip/select</em> to set.  Selecting
		a strip in the GUI will set OSC surface select and the surface
		will set GUI selection as well.
	</li>
	<li>
		Local expansion: Use <em>/strip/expand</em> to expand a strip
		without changing overall selection. When /strip/expand is set
		to 0 or false, the select channel will go back to using the
		strip selected by the GUI. While expand is turned on,
		selecting a strip on the GUI does not
		select the OSC strip. Sending a /strip/select message will
		override the expand as if it had been set to false.
		Good for more than one OSC controller at a time.
	</li>
  </ul>

<p class="note">
	<code>/select/send_page</code> and <code>/select/plugin_page</code> may be used
	with a page up and page down switch by using a switch with a value of <code>1</code>
	for page up and a switch with a value of <code>-1</code> for page down. An encoder
	can be used as well. (these commands were added in Ardour version 5.10)
</p>
<h4 id="groups">Using groups with strip and select (new for Ardour 6.0)</h4>
<p class="note">
	No grouping will occure unless <code>use_group</code> is set either
	by using <kbd class="osc">/set_surface/strip_types</kbd> with the use groups bit set
	or by using <kbd class="osc">/use_group i 1</kbd>.
</p>
	<p>
		The result for <kbd class="osc">/strip/group</kbd> or
		<kbd class="osc">/select/group</kbd> is determined by the parameter
		passed in the command and the current group and available list of
		groups. The group name the control surface sends may be:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			"none", "" or " " will remove this strip from this group. If this
			was the only strip in this group, the group is deleted. Some
			OSC controllers have trouble sending an empty string and a
			list of groups contains "none" as well so a dropdown can just
			send a text item and work.
		</li>
		<li>
			The name of a group this strip does not belong to will remove
			this strip from it's current group and add it to the named group.
			If this strip was the only strip in the group it was removed from,
			that group will be deleted.
		</li>
		<li>
			An unused name when this strip is not part of a group will create
			a new group with the group name sent and add this strip to that
			group
		</li>
		<li>
			An unused name when this strip is already a part of a group will
			rename this group to the name sent.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To create a new group from a strip that is already joined to a group,
	the strip must first remove itself from the current group.
	</p>
<h4 id="spill">Spill Strips</h4>
<p><kbd class="osc">/select/spill</kbd> or <kbd class="osc">/strip/spill</kbd>
	will:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			set the current set of strips in use to include only the strips
			that are a part of the group the strip is a part of so long
			as that strip is a track.</li>
		<li>
			set the current set of strips to the set of strips that feed
			this strip if it is a bus. In the case where this strip is
			being fed by sends rather than strip outputs, the strips that
			feed this bus will have their names set to the name of the strip
			with <em>-send</em> appended to it and the fader, pan and mute will
			control the send rather than the strip. The other strip controls
			will be disabled in this mode. This only happens when the strip
			that calls spill is a bus. In the case where a strip that is part
			of a group is chosen as above where the group all sends to a common
			bus this will not happen. This can be useful for a group that uses
			"Add New Aux Bus" to switch from sends to faders.</li>
		<li>
			set the current set of strips to the set of strips that are
			controled by the VCA if this strip is a VCA.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>spill/group, spill/bus or spill/vca can also be used to force
	the type of spilling that is done. This may be useful if the strip
	is a bus that is a part of a group and the group variation is required.</p>
	<p>In all cases, if there is a bus or VCA attached to the group of strips
	it will be included as well.</p>
	<P>What is less obvious, is how to return to the normal set of strips.
	There are a number of ways of doing so depending on the operator's wishes.
	The most obvious way is to use <kbd class="osc">/set_surface/strip_types</kbd>
	to set the strip list as desired. It is expected that a control surface
	may have more than one strip types button in any case to see only
	inputs or only busses etc and of course one to give a full mix. Another
	option is to reselect the custom set of strips with
	<kbd class="osc">/strip/custom/mode <em>mode</em></kbd>.
</p>

<h3 id="menu">Menu actions</h3>
<p>
  Every single menu item in Ardour's GUI is accessible via OSC. There is
  a single common syntax to trigger the action as if it was selected
  with the mouse (or keyboard):</p>
<kbd class="osc">/access_action <em>action_name</em></kbd>
<p>
  As of Ardour 5.9, <em>access_action</em> can be inlined for control surfaces
  that are unable to send string parameters. The <em>action_name</em> is composed of
  a group and an action in the form of <em>Group/action</em> which fits very well
  as an OSC path extension:
</p>
<kbd class="osc">/access_action/<em>Group/action</em> <em>key_pressed</em></kbd>
<p>
  The key_pressed is optional, but if present is a float 1 or 0 where the
  command is ignored if key_pressed is  0.
</p>
<p class="note">
  Some of the Menu Actions duplicate other OSC commands. In all cases it is better
  to use the OSC commands rather than the Menu Actions if possible as the OSC commands
  are more direct.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="@@list-of-menu-actions"> list of actions</a>
  shows all available values of <em>action-name</em> for Ardour.
</p>

<!--p> These listed below are still working but may in the future not work
any more. All of them are just short cuts to a menu action and since menu
actions can now be "inlined", all known OSC controllers can call them directly.
Any of these actions that can be moved to session->action calls may reapear.
