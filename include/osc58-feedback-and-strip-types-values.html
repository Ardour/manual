<p><em>/set_surface</em> has two values the user needs to calculate before
  use. In general these will not be calculated at run time, but
  beforehand. There may be more than one button with different values
  to turn various kinds of feedback on or off or to determine which
  kinds of strips are currently viewed/controlled.
</p>
<p>Both <em>feedback</em> and <em>strip-types</em> use bitsets to keep
  track what they are doing. Any number in a computer is made out of
  bits that are on or off, but we represent them as normal base 10
  numbers. Any one bit turned on will add a unique value to the
  number as a whole. So for each kind of feedback or strip type
  to be used, that number should be added to the total.</p>
<h2>strip_types</h2>
<p>
  strip_types is an integer made up of bits. The easy way to
  deal with this is to think of strip_types items being worth a number and
  then adding all those numbers together for a value to send.
  Strip Types will determine What kind of strips will be included in
  bank. This would include: Audio, MIDI, busses, VCAs, Master, Monitor
  and hidden or selected strips.

	</li>
  </ul>
<p class="note">
  Selected and Hidden bits are normally not needed as Ardour defaults to
  showing Selected strips and not showing Hidden strips. The purpose of
  these two flags is to allow showing only Selected strips or only
  Hidden strips. Using Hidden with other flags will allow Hidden strips
  to show inline with other strips.
</p>
<p class="note" id="use-group">
	Use Group on will tell ardour that any control on a strip that is part
	of a group will affect all strips within that group. Default is off
	or the control should only affect the strip the control is applied to.
	The <code>/use_group f state</code> command can be used to temporarily
	change this on the fly.
</p>
<p>
  Some handy numbers to use might be: 15 (all tracks and busses -
  1 + 2 + 4 + 8), 31
  (add VCAs to that - 15 + 16). Master or Monitor strips are generally
  not useful on a surface that has dedicated controls for these strips
  as there are /master* and /monitor* commands already. However, on a
  surface with just a bank of fader strips, adding master or monitor
  would allow access to them within the banks. Selected would be useful
  for working on a group or a set of user selected strips. Hidden shows
  strips the GUI has hidden. As such, a control surface will likely have
  a number of buttons with different strip_types for convenience.

<h3 id="hidden">Using hidden strips</h3>
<p>
	Ardour allows any of it's strips to be hidden so that they do not show
	up on the GUI mixer or editor. OSC follows the GUI by default and will
	not show hidden strips. As of Ardour 6.0 the OSC commands include
	<kbd class="osc">/select/hide <em>y/n</em></kbd> for the selected
	strip and <kbd class="osc">/strip/hide <em>ssid</em> <em>y/n</em></kbd>
	for any strip. This allows the control surface to hide or unhide a strip.
	What may not be obvious is that hiding a strip makes it disappear and
	become unselected. So if a selected strip is hidden, it is no longer
	selected and the select channel will show the default select strip
	(Master). In order to show a hidden strip, the hidden strips need to
	be shown first using the <kbd class="osc">/set_surface/strip_types 512</kbd>
	command to show only hidden strips. Then use the
	<kbd class="osc">/strip/hide <em>SSID</em> 0</kbd> or
	<kbd class="osc">/select/hide 0</kbd>
	to show that strip. Of course, because only hidden strips are showing,
	the strip you have set to no long hide will seem to vanish. A
	<kbd class="osc">/set_surface/strip_types 159</kbd> will then show
	the default strip types or replace the 159 with the desired strip_types.
</p>
<p class="note">
	When hiding more than one strip in a row, check the strip name before
	hiding as the strips will move as each strip is hidden just as it does
	with the GUI mixer. So to hide strips 5, 6 and 7, the hide button
	for <code>ssid</code> 5 is pressed 3 times. A more intuitive method
	would be to hide strips from right to left (7, 6 and 5) which will
	work as expected.
<p>
	In short, shown strips can only be hidden when they are viewable and
	hidden strip can only shown (or un-hid) when strip_types include hidden
	strips.
</p>
<h2 id="feedback">feedback</h2>
<p>Feedback is an integer made up of bits. The easy way to
  deal with this is to think of feedback items being worth a number and
  then adding all those numbers together for a value to send.
</p>
  <ul>
	<li>
		1: Button status for strips.
	</li>
	<li>
		2: Variable control values for strips.
	</li>
	<li>
		4: Send SSID as path extension.
	</li>
	<li>
		8: heartbeat to surface.
	</li>
	<li>
		16: Enable master section feedback.
	</li>
	<li>
		32: Send Bar and Beat.
	</li>
	<li>
		64: Send timecode.
	</li>
	<li>
		128: Send meter as dB (-193 to +6) or 0 to 1 depending on gainmode
	</li>
	<li>
		256: Send meter a 16 bit value where each bit is a level
		and all bits of lower level are on. For use in a LED strip. This
		will not work if the above option is turned on.
	</li>
	<li>
		512: Send signal present, true if level is higher than -40dB
	</li>
	<li>
		1024: Send position in samples
	</li>
	<li>
		2048: Send position in time, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds
	</li>
 	<li>
		8192: Turn on select channel feedback
	</li>
 	<li>
		16384: Use OSC 1.0 /reply instead of #reply
	</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  So using a value of 19 (1 + 2 + 16) would turn on feedback for strip
  and master controls, but leave meters, timecode and bar/beat feedback off.
