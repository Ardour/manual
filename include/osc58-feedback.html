<p>
  Feedback from the Ardour to the the control surface is very useful for
  a number of things. Motor faders need to know where the the track
  they have been attached to is at before they were assigned otherwise
  the DAW fader will jump to where the controller fader is. Likewise,
  the buttons on each strip need to know what their value is so they can
  light their LED correctly. Transport controls should let you know if
  they are active too. This is what feedback is all about.
</p>
<p>
  Ardour does feedback by sending the same path back that is used to
  control the same function. As such any controls that have feedback
  have a parameter that is the value of the control or its state
  (on or off). In the case of OSC paths listed on the main OSC page
  as having no parameter, if they have feedback, they will also work
  with a 1 for button press and 0 for button release. This is because
  many OSC controllers will only use exactly the same path for feedback
  as for control. For example:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th><kbd class="osc">/transport_stop</kbd></th>
  <td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>can be used also in the form:</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th><kbd class="osc">/transport_stop <em>press</em></kbd></th>
  <td>where <em>press</em> is an int/bool indicating if the button is pressed or not.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  The feedback does not have the same meaning as the control message.
  Where the button release sent to Ardour will be ignored and has no
  meaning. Both states have meaning in feedback to the controller.
  The feedback will be:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th><kbd class="osc">/transport_stop <em>state</em></kbd></th>
  <td>where <em>state</em> is an int/bool indicating if the transport is stopped or not.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
  With feedback turned on, OSC control commands that try to change a
  control that does not exist will get feedback that resets that control
  to off. For example, sending a /strip/recenable to a buss will not work
  and Ardour will try to turn the controller LED off in that case. Also
  note that Pan operation may be limited by pan width in some cases.
  That is with pan width at 100% (or -100%) there is no pan position
  movement available.
</p>
<p>
  It may come as a surprise, but feedback often generates more network
  traffic than control itself does. Some things are more obvious like
  head position or meters. But even a simple button push like transport
  start sends not only a signal to turn on the play LED, but also one to
  turn off the stop LED, the Rewind LED, the Fast Forward LED and the
  Loop LED. That is still minor, think instead of a surface refresh
  such as happens when the surface is first connected and then most of
  that happens every time the fader strips are banked. This is why
  feedback is enabled in sections so that as little feedback as is
  actually needed is sent. This is also a consideration if the surface
  is connected via wifi.

<h2>List of OSC feedback messages</h2>

<h3>Feedback only</h3>
<p>
  These messages are feedback only. They are sent as status from Ardour
  and some of them may be enabled separately from other feedback. See:
  <a href="@@osc58-feedback-and-strip-types-values#feedback">
  Calculating Feedback and Strip-types Values.</a>
</p>
<p class="note">
  See strip section below for info about ssid and wrapping it into the
  path. Also /master and /monitor support what the /strip does.
</p>
<p>
  In the case where Gainmode is set to position, the track name will
  show the dB value while values are changing.

  Some Surfaces (many Android applets) are not able to deal with more
  than one parameter in a command. However, the two parameter commands
  below can also be sent as /strip/command/ssid param. Feedback can be
  set to match this with the /set_surface/feedback <em>state</em>
  command. See <a

<h3>Menu actions</h3>
<p class="note">
	There is no feedback for Menu actions.
</p>
<p>
  Every single menu item in Ardour's GUI is accessible via OSC. However,
  there is no provision for returning the state of anything set this way.
  This is not a bad thing as most menu items either do not have an on/off
  state or that state is quite visible. Bindings that affect other parameters
  that OSC does track will show on those OSC controls. Examples of this
  might be track record enable for tracks 1 to 32, play or stop.
