<p>
	As of Ardour 6.0, Ardour provides the possibility of linking two or
	more surface to work as one surface. This means that two surfaces,
	one with 8 strips and one with 6 strips would look like a single 14
	strip surface. A <code>/bank_up</code> or down on either surface with bank the two
	so that they bank in 14 strip increments.
</p>
<p class="note">
	Ardour 5.0 to 5.12 can use two surfaces as shown in <a href="#example3">Example 3</a>.
</p>
<h2>Surface Linking Concepts</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
	  <li>A group of surfaces linked together are called a <code>Link Set</code>. A
	  <code>Link Set</code> is called by a positive integer number.</li>
	  <li>There may be more than one <code>Link Set</code> at a time used
	  with Ardour.</li>
	  <li>Each surface inside a <code>Link Set</code> has a <code>Link Id</code>.</li>
	  <li>The <code>Link ID</code> is a positive integer numbering consecutive
	  surfaces starting from 1 for the left most and going up to the right. So
	  if there are three surfaces in a <code>Link Set</code>, The left surface
	  will have a <code>Link Id</code> of <em>1</em>, the middle surface will
	  have a <code>Link Id</code> of <em>2</em> and the right surface will
	  have a <code>Link Id</code> of <em>3</em>.</li>
	  <li>There may not be skipped <code>Link Ids</code>. If there are a
	  surface 1 and 3, there must also be a surface 2. Surface 1 must always
	  exist. If any surface is missing, the track names will indicate the
	  <code>Link Id</code> of the first device missing.</li>
	  <li>In most things, surfaces are separate and can do things independently.
		<ul>
		  <li>Each surface can have a different <code>Gain Mode</code></li>
		  <li>Each surface has it's own <code>Bank Size</code></li>
		  <li>Each surface has it's own <code>Feedback</code></li>
		  <li>Each surface has it's own <em>Expanded Strip</em></li>
		</ul>
		However, some things are shared by all surfaces in a <code>Link Set</code>:
		<ul>
		  <li>Banking is done as a unit and each surface bank start is
		  determined by the <code>Link Set</code>. Any surface can
		  <em>Bank Up</em> or <em>Bank Down</em>.</li>
		  <li>All surfaces share the same <em>strip types</em>. Setting
		  <em>Strip Types</em> in any one surface sets it for the whole
		  <code>Link Set</code>.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2>Setting Up a Link Set</h2>
<p>
	There are only two OSC commands needed to set up a <code>Link Set</code>:
</p>
<table class="dl">
  <tr><th><kbd class="osc">/link/set <em>linkset</em> <em>linkid</em></kbd></th>
  <td>Where <em>linkset</em> is the Link Set this surface will be added to and
  <em>linkid</em> is the Link Id of this surface.</td></tr>
  <tr><th><kbd class="osc">/link/bank_size <em>linkset</em> <em>banksize</em></kbd></th>
  <td>Where <em>linkset</em> is the Link Set this surface will be added to and
  <em>banksize</em> is the target bank size for this Link Set. This Link Set
  will not operate unless the total strip numbers is <em>banksize</em>.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
	It is also possible to send link set and ID values as part of a
	<code>/set_surface</code> command.

  <kbd class="osc">/set_surface <em>bank_size</em> <em>strip_types</em>
  <em>feedback</em> <em>fadermode</em> <em>send_page_size</em> <em>plugin_page_size</em>
  <em>port</em> <em>linkset</em> <em>linkid</em></kbd>

</p>
<p> The <code>/link/bank_size</code> command is optional. Ardour defaults
	to linking with auto sizing banks where the <code>Link Set</code>
	bank size is determined by adding the available surface bank sizes
	together. So long as the <code>Link Ids</code> are consecutive, the
	<code>Link Set</code> is considered ready. If the surface wants to make
	sure all surfaces are present before the <code>Link Set</code> is
	ready, the <code>/link/bank_size</code> command will not allow the
	<code>Link Set</code> to be ready until the surface bank sizes add up
	to the <code>Link Set's</code> bank size.
</p>
<p>
	Setting up a linked set of surfaces is a simple as choosing a number
	for the <code>Link Set</code>, <em>1</em> will work fine if there is
	only one linked set of surfaces, and giving each surface a <code>
	Link Id</code>. This can be done with the same method as the <code>
	/set_surface</code> command is sent or by having each surface send
	the <code>/link/set</code> command. As with other commands, the first
	parameter (linkset) may be sent inline: <code>/link/set/1 <em>linkid</em></code>
	for those surfaces unable to send multi parameter OSC messages.
</p>
<h2>Example Multi Device Surfaces</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>
	Assuming two devices, the left device has 8 strips and very little
	else on it's main page or tab. It may have secondary pages or tabs or
	a physical control section to access the extra selected strip controls
	like send levels or plugin controls. The right device has only 6
	strips because it also has Master and Monitor channel as well as
	transport controls. It also has a select section. As part of it's
	Global controls it has a Bank up and a bank down button. (there is
	nothing stopping the left surface from also having banking buttons)
	The left surface will be linkid <em>1</em> and the right surface will be
	linkid <em>2</em>. For this example the linkset will be <em>1</em>.
</p>
<p>
	Device <em>1</em> will have a "Connect" button that will send:
	<code>/set_surface iiiiiiiii 8 159 8323 0 0 0 0 1 1</code> and the second
	device will have two buttons. One will be a "Connect" button that
	sends: <code>/set_surface iiii 6 159 8403 0</code> and the other
	will be a "Link" button that will send: <code>/link/set ii 1 2</code>.
	These devices use two different methods of setup both to illustrate
	their use and because this will allow them to be used unlinked. Device
	<em>1</em> even as a linked device will operate on it's own as a one
	device <code>Link Set</code>. However, device <em>2</em> would show
	an error condition if device <em>1</em> is not present so we have a
	separate "Link" button. This is an optional way of doing things and
	both could use just one "Connect" button or both could have a separate
	"Link" button. Device <em>2</em> could also have an "Unlink" button
	that sends: <code>/link/set ii 0 0</code> if desired.
</p>
<p>
	To use these two devices as one, the "Connect" button on both devices and
	the "Link" button on the second device are pressed in any order. The two
	surfaces will now act as one surface with 14 bankable strips.
</p>
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>
	This example will be more complex and use a total of five devices. The
	first three devices will form Link Set <em>1</em> and have 8 strips each.
	They are similar to the left device above, but will only show "input"
	strips. The last two devices will form Link Set <em>2</em>. Device <em>1</em>
	will be similar to the first three devices with 8 strips and the other
	will be similar to the 6 strip device in example 1 having Master and
	transport controls as well. The devices in Link Set 2 will be set up
	to only use bus and VCA strips and so don't need to include record
	enable buttons etc. It is expected that all devices have
	banking buttons, but at least one surface in each Link Set would have
	to have them.
</p>
<p>
	Devices 1 to 3 (from left to right) would each have a "Connect"
	button that sends: <code>/set_surface iiiiiiiii 8 3 8323 0 0 0 0 1 n</code>
	where <em>n</em> is the position or Link Id of that surface from 1 to
	3, left to right. Device 4 would use: <code>/set_surface iiiiiiiii 8
	156 8323 0 0 0 0 2 1</code> and device 5 would use: <code>/set_surface
	iiiiiiiii 6 156 8403 0 0 0 0 2 2</code>.
</p>
<p>
	As before, the "Connect" on each surface is pressed in any order and
	the resulting surface would have 24 input strips where the banking
	buttons on any of the first three surfaces would bank those three
	surfaces 24 strips at a time through the input strips (assuming more
	than 24 input strips are available). The last two strips would form
	a master and bus section with 14 bus only strips that will bank through
	the bus strips (assuming more than 14 bus strips). This combined
	surface would have 38 strips (plus Master) all together.
</p>
<h2 id="example3">Example 3</h2>
<p>
	In this example there are two devices as in example 1. However, the
	goal is to have only input strips on the left device and only bus strips,
	Master and transport controls on the right device. In this case linking
	is not needed. The left device would use a "Connect" button that sent:
	<code>/set_surface iiii 8 3 8323 0</code> and the right device would
	use a "Connect" button that sent: <code>/set_surface iiii 6 156 8403 0</code>.
	The banking buttons on the left surface would bank through the input
	channels and the banking buttons on the right surface would bank
	through the buses and VCAs. As this example does not use Ardours OSC
	linking commands, it will also work with Ardour versions 5.0 to 5.12.
