	Personal monitoring can allow a performer with a smart phone to set
	their personal monitor mix for a floor wedge or inear monitoring.
	In Ardour 5.6 OSC commands to allow this were added.
</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>
	Some setup needs to be done in the GUI mixer window before this can
	work.
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Create a bus for each performer who will have personal
			monitoring. A good practice is to name the bus with the
			performers name.
		</li>
		<li>
			Connect the output of that bus to one of the audio
			interface's playback ports that is not otherwise used. OSC
			will now include this bus in it's list of aux buses as it
			no longer has it's output connected to the Master bus.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add an aux send to each channel the performer needs to hear
			in their personal mix. Many performers only need three or
			four sources to be mixed. If the performer needs to hear a
			a set of inputs that are combined into a bus, adding the
			aux send to that bus may make more sense than adding ten
			drum channels for example.
		</li>
		<li>
			If the performer wishes to hear effects in their monitor,
			an extra send from the send bus, placing the performers aux
			send after the effect or a plugin can be added in line in
			the aux bus itself.
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>
	This gives stage or studio monitoring for the performer.

<h3>The OSC commands and feedback for personal monitoring</h3>
<p>
	All of the personal monitoring commands and feedback start with a
	<em>/cue</em>. It is expected that a surface used as a personal
	monitor control will use only <em>/cue</em> commands.
</p>
<p class="note">
	The send controls and feedback all have the send id (1 to n) in line
	as part of the OSC path. So the path for the second send would be
	<em>/cue/send/fader/2</em> to set the level. It is considered that
	most surfaces used for this will only be able to handle one parameter.

<dl class="bindings">
  <dt><kbd class="osc">/cue/connect</kbd></dt>
  <dd>Returns a list of aux buses.</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="osc">/cue/aux <em>aux-number</em></kbd></dt>
  <dd>where <em>aux-number</em> is an integer which is the aux bus
  number this surface will use.</dd>

  <dt><kbd class="osc">/cue/send/fader/<em>id</em> <em>position</em></kbd></dt>
  <dd>where <em>position</em> is a float for the position of the fader
  between 0.0 and 1.0.</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="osc">/cue/send/enable/<em>id</em> <em>state</em></kbd></dt>

</dl>
<h4>Feedback</h4>
<dl class="bindings">
  <dt><kbd class="osc">/cue/name <em>name</em></kbd></dt>
  <dd>where <em>name</em> is a string that is the name of the currently
  selected aux bus.</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="osc">/cue/name/<em>id</em> <em>name</em></kbd></dt>
  <dd>where <em>name</em> is a string that is the name of the aux bus
  that <em>id</em> belongs to.</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="osc">/cue/fader <em>position</em></kbd></dt>
  <dd>where <em>position</em> is a float from 0.0 to 1.0 that shows the
  fader position for the selected aux bus.</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="osc">/cue/mute <em>state</em></kbd></dt>
  <dd>where <em>state</em> is a float of 0.0 or 1.0 that shows the state
  of the mute for the selected aux bus.</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="osc">/cue/signal <em>activity</em></kbd></dt>
  <dd>where <em>activity</em> is a float of 0.0 or 1.0 that shows audio
  activity for the selected aux bus.</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="osc">/cue/send/name/<em>id</em> <em>name</em></kbd></dt>
  <dd>where <em>name</em> is a string that is the name of the channel
  that send <em>id</em> belongs to.</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="osc">/cue/send/fader/<em>id</em> <em>position</em></kbd></dt>
  <dd>where <em>position</em> is a float from 0.0 to 1.0 that is the position
  for the fader for the send that <em>id</em> belongs to.</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="osc">/cue/send/enable/<em>id</em> <em>state</em></kbd></dt>
  <dd>where <em>state</em> is a float of 0.0 or 1.0 that is the state
  of the enable for the send that <em>id</em> belongs to.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
	While a fader is being adjusted, the corresponding <em>/*/name</em>
	text will give the level in db.
