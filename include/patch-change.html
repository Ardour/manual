  A <dfn>patch change</dfn> is Ardour's description for a combination
  of MIDI program change and bank select messages, that (typically)
  instruct a synthesizer or sampler to select a different sound to use
  on a particular channel.
</p>
<p>
  Patch changes are shown within MIDI regions as small rectangles or
  <dfn>flags</dfn>, as shown below:
</p>

<h2>Inserting Patch Changes</h2>
<p>
  Ensure that the
  <a href="/ardours-interface/the-edit-point-control/">edit point</a> is 
  located where you want the patch change to be (within an existing
  MIDI region). Context click, and from the MIDI region's context menu,
  select <kbd class="menu">MIDI &gt; Insert Patch Change</kbd>. A
  dialog will appear allowing you to set the bank and program values.
</p>

<h2>Modifying Patch Changes</h2>
<p>
  Context-clicking on a patch change will bring up the same dialog that
  was used to create it, allowing you to modify the program and/or bank
  numbers.
</p>
<p>
  You can also use the mouse wheel: <kbd class="mouse">&uArr;</kbd>/<kbd
  class="mouse">&dArr;</kbd> on the patch change will alter the program
  number, <kbd class="mouse mod1">&uArr;</kbd>/<kbd
  class="mouse mod1">&dArr;</kbd> will modify the bank number.
</p>

<h2>Moving Patch Changes</h2>
<p>
  Just <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd>-drag on the patch change to move it
  around.
</p>

<h2>Removing Patch Changes</h2>
<p>
  Put the mouse pointer into the rectangular area, and press <kbd>Del</kbd>
  or use the delete mouse button operation. This will remove the patch change
  (the operation can be undone).
