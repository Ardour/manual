<p>
  A <dfn>patch change</dfn> is Ardour's description for a combination
  of MIDI program change and bank select messages, that (typically)
  instruct a synthesizer or sampler to select a different sound to use
  on a particular channel.
</p>
<p>
  Patch changes are shown within MIDI regions as small rectangles or
  <dfn>flags</dfn>, with a vertical line showing where in the region
  (hence "when") this patch change happens.
</p>

<h2>Inserting Patch Changes</h2>
<p>
  To insert a patch change, the <a href="@@edit-point-control">edit point</a>
  should be located where the patch change should be (within an existing MIDI
  region). When <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd> clicking, and from the MIDI
  region's context menu, selecting <kbd class="menu">MIDI &gt; Insert Patch
  Change</kbd>, a dialog appears allowing to set the bank and program values.
</p>

<h2>Modifying Patch Changes</h2>
<p>
  Context-clicking on a patch change will bring up the same dialog that
  was used to create it, allowing to modify the program and/or bank
  numbers.
</p>
<p>
  The mouse wheel can also be used: <kbd class="mouse">&uArr;</kbd>/<kbd
  class="mouse">&dArr;</kbd> on the patch change will alter the program
  number, <kbd class="mouse mod1">&uArr;</kbd>/<kbd
  class="mouse mod1">&dArr;</kbd> will modify the bank number.
</p>

<h2>Moving Patch Changes</h2>
<p>
  Just <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd>-dragging the patch change moves it
  around.
</p>

<h2>Removing Patch Changes</h2>
<p>
  Pressing <kbd>Del</kbd> with the mouse pointer into the rectangular area, or
  using the <kbd class="menu">delete</kbd> mouse button operation will remove the
  patch change (the operation can be undone).
</p>

<h2>Names for Patch Numbers: MIDNAM files</h2>
<p>
  MIDNAM files assign human-redable names to the "coordinates" (MSB, LSB, pc) of
  instruments and controls of MIDI-devices. A number of MIDNAM files come already pre-bundled
  with Ardour. Should this not be the case for your device, you can add your own (see below).
</p>

<h3>Selecting a device</h3>
<p>
  For the proper names to show up in the "Patch Selector"-dialog, you have to assign a
  device to your current track. To do so, hover the lower border of the tracks header
  (the mouse-cursor will change to a "resize-cursor") and expand it.
  You'll see dropdown menus. Select your device in the menu.
</p>

<h3>Adding a custom MIDNAM-file</h3>
<p>
  MIDNAM-files are XML-Files. You can edit them using your favorite text-editor. When
  doing so, please ensure to change the "Model" of the device, as Ardour will only load
  each model once (i.e. it will skip files, if there are clashes).
</p>
<p>
  After you have done modifications to a file, it is a good idea to validate it. This can
  be done using the tool <i>xmllint</i> as shown below:
</p>
<pre><code class="bash">
$ xmllint --valid --noout myfile.midnam
$ wget http://www.midi.org/dtds/MIDINameDocument10.dtd
$ xmllint --dtdvalid MIDINameDocument10.dtd myfile.midnam
</code></pre>
<p>
  Once you are satisfied with your file, you have to put it at a location where Ardour
  picks it up. The best place would be the (hidden) directory
  <a href="@@files-and-directories-ardour-knows-about">Ardour configuration directory</a>
  subdirectory patchfiles.
  in your home-folder. Should the sub-directory <i>patchfiles</i> not exist yet, just
  create it. The path and file-names are case-sensitive. The file should end with
  "<i>.midnam</i>".
</p>
<p>
  After restarting Ardour, hit the small Log-button in the upper right corner of the
  main window. It should say something like
  (this is Linux, Macos or Windows will be different):
</p>
<pre>[INFO]: Loading 3 MIDI patches from /home/username/.config/ardour5/patchfiles</pre>
<p>
  The added device should now show up in the dropdown mentioned in the previous paragraph.
</p>
<p>
  Should the MIDNAM-file be useful for the general public, it would be nice to share it:
  Fork the Ardour-project on <a href="https://github.com/Ardour/ardour">gitHub</a> by
  hitting the "Fork"-Button. Go to the <a>patchfiles</a>-directory (and read the README).
</p>
<p>
  You can upload the file using the Web-Interface. Be sure to select
  "<i>Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request</i>".
