<p>
  A <dfn>Patch Change</dfn> is Ardour's description for a combination of MIDI
  program change and bank select messages, that typically instruct a
  synthesizer or sampler to select a sound to use on any given channel. Patch
  changes are shown within MIDI regions as small rectangles or
  <dfn>flags</dfn>, with a vertical line showing where in the region the patch
  change will occur.

<p>
  A patch change is inserted by first ensuring that the mouse is in <a
  href="@@toolbox">Grab Mode</a>, then <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd>-clicking
  on the MIDI region where the patch changed is desired, then selecting <kbd
  class="menu">&lt;Region Name&gt; &gt; MIDI &gt; Insert Patch Change...</kbd>.
  The desired patch is then chosen from the dialog that appears.
<p>

<p class="note">
  Inserted patch changes always appear in the selected region at the <a
  href="@@edit-point-control">Edit Point</a>.
</p>

<h2>Modifying Patch Changes</h2>

<p>
  A patch change can be modified by <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd>-clicking on
  it, then selecting the desired patch from the menu that appears. A patch
  change can also be modified by hovering the mouse pointer over the patch
  change to be modified and moving the mouse wheel until the desired program
  number is selected. The bank number can be modified similarly by holding down
  the <kbd class="mod3"></kbd> key while moving the mouse wheel until the
  desired bank is selected.
</p>

<h2>Moving Patch Changes</h2>

<p>
  A patch change can be moved, within the region in which it resides, by <kbd
  class="mouse">left</kbd>-clicking it and dragging it to the desired location.
</p>

<h2>Removing Patch Changes</h2>

<p>
  A patch change can be removed by holding down the <kbd class="mod3"></kbd> key
  and then <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd>-clicking on it.
</p>

<h2 id="midnam">Names for Patch Numbers: MIDNAM files</h2>

<p>
  MIDNAM files assign human-readable names to the "sound coordinates" (Program
  Change, Bank Select) of MIDI synthesizers and devices. A number of MIDNAM
  files come bundled with Ardour; if the MIDNAM for a device is not included
  with Ardour, <a href="@@midnam-ref">a custom MIDNAM file can be created</a>
  for device in question.
</p>

<h3>Selecting a device</h3>

<p>
  Selecting a MIDNAM is only possible if there is no MIDI synth on the track in
  question or the MIDI synth does not have a MIDNAM associated with it. In this
  case, it is possible to select the desired MIDNAM from a combobox in the MIDI
  track's header, usually directly below the track's fader. See <a
  href="@@midi-track-controls">MIDI Track Controls</a> for more details.
