	The <dfn>Performance Meters</dfn> window provides low-level metering
	of the digital signal processing taking place inside Ardour.
	One of the scenarios where this is useful is when you need to determine
	whether Ardour is in charge for excessive xruns.

	This window displays worst case scenario measurements that do not necessarily match the DSP meter in the top right corner of the window. To see average
	and standard deviation values, hover either the Engine or the Session values
	with the mouse pointer to see the tooltip.
