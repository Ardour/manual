	It is possible to play both individual clips and entire cues.
</p>

<h2>Playing Individual Clips</h2>

<p>
	There are generally two ways to trigger a slot with a clip inside.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Pressing a mouse button over the button to the left of the
	clip's name (Ardout defaults to Trigger launch style which has a classical
	triangle playback icon)</li>
	<li>Sending a note-on event from an external or a virtual MIDI
	controller</li>
</ol>

<p>
	How Ardour responds to releasing the mouse button or sending a note-off
	event depends on the trigger launch style.
	<a href="@@clip-launch-options">This chapter</a> covers that topic.
</p>

<p>
	Once the clip starts playing, the playback indication panel for that track
	lights up with some information:
</p>

  <img style="width:75%;" src="/images/trigger-slot-playing.png" alt="Playback indication">

</figure>

<p>
	Left to right:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Clip progress, in the form of a sliding pie chart</li>
	<li>Which cue is playing (it's C on the screenshot)</li>
	<li>MIDI clip indication, an icon representing two beamed 1/16 notes</li>
	<li>Follow count, e.g. '1/2' on the screenshot means the clip is currently being played
	the first time out of two times total</li>
</ul>

<p>
	One way to stop a playing clip is to click the square-shaped icon
	in any of the empty slots in the track of interest.
