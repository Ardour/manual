<h3>Using Playlists for Parallel Processing</h3>
<p>
  One of the uses of playlists is to apply multiple effects to the same audio
  stream. For example, applying two different non-linear effects such as
  distortion or compression to the same audio source (linear effects can be just
  applied one after the other in the same track) can be done by creating a new
  track, applying the original track's playlist, and then applying effects to
  both tracks independently.
</p>
<p class="note">
  The same result could be achieved by feeding the track to multiple busses
  which then contain the processing, but this increases the overall latency,
  complicates routing and uses more space in the Mixer window.
</p>

<h2>Using Playlists for "Takes"</h2>
<p>
  Using Playlists for <dfn>takes</dfn> is a good solution when one needs the
  ability to edit individual takes, and select between them.
</p>
<p>
  Each time a new take is started, a new playlist should be created with <kbd
  class="menu">p &gt; New</kbd>. Thus, later, any previous or later takes can be
  selected as desired.
</p>
<p>
  Creating a composite edit from multiple takes, can be achieved either:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>by creating a new track to assemble the final version, and "cherry picking" from
   the playlists in the original track by copying regions over as required</li>
  <li>by recording each successive take on top of the others in "layers" and then
  editing them using the layer tools.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using Playlists for Multi-Language Productions</h2>
<p>
  The same approach as for takes is useful when recording or editing content in
  multiple versions, such as dubbed movie dialog in several languages: having
  all versions on the same track allows to apply the same processing, making it
  easy to switch language before exporting the session.
