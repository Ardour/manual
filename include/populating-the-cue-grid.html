<h2>Adding tracks</h2>

<p>
	You can add tracks in the <dfn>Cue</dfn> window the usual way,
	either by double-clicking on the free space in the canvas or
	by choosing the <kbd class="menu">Track &gt; Add Track, Bus, or VCA</kbd>
	menu item. The important part is to enable the
	<kbd class="option">Show on Cue Page</kbd> checkbox in the newly
	opened dialog.
</p>

<p>
	Alternatively, you can drop an existing audio or MIDI file into
	the empty part of the canvas to automatically create the cue track
	and fill the first empty trigger slot with it. 
</p>

<h2>Loading clips to slots</h2>

<p>
	There are several ways to load a clip into a trigger slot:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
	From right click menu: right-click over a trigger slot, choose
	<kbd class="menu">Load</kbd>, select an audio or a MIDI file.
</li>
<li>
	From <dfn>Clip Properties</dfn> box: click the
	<kbd class="button">Load</kbd> button, select an audio or a MIDI file.
</li>
<li>
	From the <dfn>Clips</dfn> library: choose an audio or a MIDI file,
	listen to it before adding, then pick, drag towards the grid and drop
	into a trigger slot.
</li>
<li>
	From the timeline: select a region, right-click, choose
	<kbd class="menu">{Region Name} > Bounce (with processing)</kbd> or
	<kbd class="menu">{Region Name} > Bounce (without processing)</kbd>,
	then enable the <kbd class="option">Bounce to Trigger Slot</kbd> checkbox
	and choose the cue.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting Clip Properties</h2>

<p>
	The contents of this options box partially depends on the type of data
	in the clip, audio or MIDI. The common settings are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<dfn>Name</dfn>: the full name of the clip's file, usually visible in its
		shortened form.
	</li>
	<li>
		<dfn>Load</dfn>: this button allows loading a clip's file into
		the selected trigger slot.
	</li>
	<li>
		<dfn>Color</dfn>: here you can open a color chooser dialog to set
		the color of the clip's title inside the trigger slot.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The only audio-specific setting is <dfn>Gain (dB)</dfn> which adjusts
	the output volume of a clip.
</p>

<p>
	For MIDI clips, there are several specific options:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<dfn>Velocity Adj</dfn>: this effectively adjusts the output volume
		by increasing the velocity of MIDI notes.
	</li>
	<li>
		<dfn>Send Patches</dfn>: this enables sending a control message
		to load a particular patch. This is typically used for external
		MIDI gear such a hardware synthesizers.
	</li>
	<li>
		<dfn>MIDI Patches</dfn>: clicking this button will open a dialog
		where you can select a patch to send when a MIDI clip is triggered.
	</li>
</ul>
