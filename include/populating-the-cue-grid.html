<h2>Adding tracks</h2>

<p>
	It's possible to add tracks in the <dfn>Cue</dfn> window the usual way,
	either by double-clicking on the free space in the canvas or
	by choosing the <kbd class="menu">Track &gt; Add Track, Bus, or VCA</kbd>
	menu item. The important part is to enable the
	<kbd class="option">Show on Cue Page</kbd> checkbox in the newly
	opened dialog.
</p>

<p>
	Alternatively, it's possible to drop an existing audio or MIDI file into
	the empty part of the canvas to automatically create the cue track
	and fill the first empty trigger slot with it.
</p>

<p>
	Trigger slots not only work as a drag-and-drop target, they also
	work as a drag-and-drop sources. It's possible to drag the contents
	of an existing trigger slot into the empty part of the canvas to create
	a new track and fill the first slot with the contents of the original
	slot. It's also possible to drag and drop the contents of one slot into
	another in case one wants to use the same clip with some variations
	(e.g. a custom follow length).
</p>

<h2>Loading clips to slots</h2>

<p>
	There are several ways to load a clip into a trigger slot:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
	From right click menu: right-click over a trigger slot, choose
	<kbd class="menu">Load</kbd>, select an audio or a MIDI file.
</li>
<li>
	From <dfn>Clip Properties</dfn> box: click the
	<kbd class="button">Load</kbd> button, select an audio or a MIDI file.
</li>
<li>
	From the <dfn>Clips</dfn> library: choose an audio or a MIDI file,
	listen to it before adding, then pick, drag towards the grid and drop
	into a trigger slot.
</li>
<li>
	From the <dfn>Regions</dfn> list: choose a region, drag it towards
	the grid and drop it into a trigger slot.
</li>
<li>
	From the timeline: select a region, right-click, choose
	<kbd class="menu">{Region Name} > Bounce (with processing)</kbd> or
	<kbd class="menu">{Region Name} > Bounce (without processing)</kbd>,
	then enable the <kbd class="option">Bounce to Trigger Slot</kbd> checkbox
	and choose the cue.
</li>
<li>
	Using bounce to create and name new clips will keep the 
	Cue Track title and Cue Clip names easily recognizable.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The type of data must match the type of tracks a clip is being inserted to.
	E.g. it's impossible to place a MIDI clip into a trigger slot of an audio
	track.
</p>

<h2>Clearing trigger slots</h2>

<p>
	There are two ways to remove an assigned clip from a selected trigger slot:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Pressing <kbd class="button">Delete</kbd> or
		<kbd class="button">Backspace</kbd>
	</li>
	<li>
		<kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd>-clicking on the trigger slot and selecting
		<kbd class="menu">Clear</kbd> in the menu.
	</li>
</ol>
