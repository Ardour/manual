	  <li>
        <dfn>Show Audio/MIDI Setup window</dfn> Shows the
        <a href="@@audio-midi-setup">Audio/MIDI Setup</a> dialog.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Try to auto-launch audio/midi engine</dfn> allows Ardour to try to
        automatically launch the audio and MIDI system, driver and device, thus not
        showing the <a href="@@audio-midi-setup">Audio/MIDI Setup</a> dialog. This
        can save a little time if the system is always used the same way.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Editor Undo</dfn> defines the behaviour of the Undo operations:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Limit undo history</strong> sets how many commands can be
	      undone using <kbd class="mod1">Z</kbd> or <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Undo</kbd>.
        Unchecking will keep an endless memory of operations to undo, at the
        expense of memory.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Save undo history</strong> sets how many commands are saved so
	      they are available to be undone after reopening the session. This can
        also be unchecked to keep all actions undoable, at the cost of bigger
        session files.
      </li>
      <li>
	      <strong>Verify removal of last capture</strong> when enabled prompts to
	      verify removal the last recording capture when
	      <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Remove Last Capture</kbd> is executed.

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Session Management</dfn>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Make periodic backups of the session file</strong> will create
        a backup session file after changes to the timeline. The backup file is
        the session name followed by <em>.ardour.bak</em>. The backup can be
        used to recover from crashes when the session had not been explicitly
        saved.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Default folder for new sessions:</strong> defaults the folder
    	where Ardour will create new session folders. This is used in the
    	<em>Session&nbsp;Setup</em> dialog displayed by
    	<kbd class="menu">Session &gt; New</kbd>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Maximum number of recent sessions:</strong> determines how 
        many of the last opened sessions shows in the <em>Recent&nbsp;Sessions</em>

        <strong>Drag and drop import always copies files to session</strong>
        selects, and then disables changes to, the <em>Copy files to session</em>
        option in the <a href="@@import-dialog">Add Existing Media</a> dialog.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cache Folder for downloaded Freesound clips</strong>: when you try
        sounds form FreeSound.org before inserting them into the project, they need
        to be saved locally on your computer; this is where you define the folder
        for those temporary files.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Export</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Save loudness analysis as image file after export</dfn> allows, when the
        <kbd class="option">Analyze Exported Audio</kbd> is checked in the
        <a href="@@export-dialog">Export dialog</a>, to save the analysis graph
        as a file named <code>session.png</code> alongside the exported audio

<h2 id="preferences-appearance">Appearance</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>GUI Lock</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Lock timeout (seconds)</dfn>: locks the <abbr title="Graphical User
        Interface">GUI</abbr> after this many idle seconds (zero being 'never lock').
        The GUI can also be locked with <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Lock</kbd>. When
        locked, a dialog will display a &quot;Click to unlock&quot; button.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>System Screensaver Mode</dfn>: can be used to prevent the
        screensaver to be launched by the system, either while recording
        (e.g. for long and unattended recording session), when Ardour is
        simply started, or never (the screensaver is then able to start).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Theme</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Color faders with track/bus colors</dfn>: when enabled, fills faders
        for tracks and busses with respective track or bus colors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Draw &quot;flat&quot; buttons</dfn>: when enabled, button controls
        in the user interface will be drawn with a flat look. When disabled button
        controls will have a slight 3D appearance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Draw &quot;boxy&quot; buttons</dfn>: when enabled, button controls
        in the user interface will have square corners instead of being slightly
        rounded.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>LED meter style</dfn> if checked, the bar meters in the editor and
        mixer will be styled to look like if they were made of LEDs, with a dotted
        bar. Unchecking this option makes the bars flat and continuous.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Graphical User Interface</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Highlight widgets on mouseover</dfn>, when checked, makes Ardour's
        widgets (buttons, sliders, &hellip;) slightly change color when the mouse
        hovers them, visually indicating what a mouse action would interact with.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show tooltips if mouse hovers over a control</dfn> when checked,
        displays a little help bubble about the control the mouse hovers. The mouse
        pointer needs to stay idle for about 1 sec for the tooltip to appear.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Update clocks at TC Frame rate</dfn>: Ardour updates its clocks every
        100&nbsp;ms. Checking this will make the clock refresh at every TimeCode
        frame which is more responsive, at the cost of a bit more system stress.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Blink Rec-Arm buttons</dfn>: when enabled, the record-armed
        buttons on tracks will blink when they are armed but not currently recording.
        When disabled, the record-armed buttons on tracks will be outlined in red
        instead of blinking. The global record-arm button in the
        <a href="@@transport-bar">Transport bar</a> is unaffected.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Blink Alert indicators</dfn>: when enabled, the Alert indicators (like
        the <kbd class="menu">Error Log</kbd> or the <kbd class="menu">Feedback</kbd>
        button) will blink when they are active (when an error or feedback
        has been detected, respectively). When disabled, the indicators will turn red instead of
        blinking.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Graphics Acceleration</dfn>
    <ul>
	  <li>
        <dfn>Use intermediate image-surface to render canvas (requires restart)</dfn>:
        Ardour uses hardware accelerated UI rendering by default for speed.
        Sometimes though, a buggy driver can cause this to make the system slow or
        unstable. Checking this will make Ardour draw its UI without
        hardware acceleration, in software, improving stability and responsiveness
        on those buggy systems at the expense of speed.

<h3 id="preferences-appearance-recorder">Recorder</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>Input Meter Layout</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Input Meter Layout</dfn>: in Recorder mode, determines if audio
        inputs are displayed horizontally or vertically.

<h3 id="preferences-appearance-editor">Editor</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>General</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Use name highlight bars in region displays (requires a restart)</dfn>:
        when enabled, the region name is displayed, in the editor, in its own opaque bar
        at the bottom of the region. When disabled, the region name is overlaid
        at the top of the region, possibly over audio waveforms or MIDI notes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Region color follows track color</dfn>: when enabled,
        the background color of regions in the editor will be displayed using
        the color assigned to the track. When disabled the default region
        background color will be used.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show Region Names</dfn>: when enabled, overlays the name of
        the region over its waveform representation, in the top-left. 
      </li>
       <li>
        <dfn>Waveforms color gradient depth:</dfn> determines how much gradient
        effect is applied to the inner of audio waveforms displayed in the editor.
        Values range from 0.0, no gradient effect, to 1.0, maximum effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Timeline item gradient depth:</dfn> Determines how much
        gradient effect is applied to the backgrounds of regions displayed in the
        editor. Values range from 0.0, no gradient effect, to 1.0, maximum effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Track name ellipsize mode:</dfn> when the track header is not 
        wide enough to display the track's name in full, selects how the
        name will be shorten between:
        <ul>
		  <li><em>Ellipsize start of name</em> will show only the end of the name</li>
		  <li><em>Ellipsize middle of name</em> will show only the start and end of the name</li>
		  <li><em>Ellipsize end of name</em> will show only the start of the name</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Add a visual gap below Audio Regions:</dfn> selects whether or
        not the audio regions fit the height of the track or leave a gap at
        the bottom, either small or large.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Editor Meters</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show meters in track headers</dfn>: when enabled, shows
        a small meter in the Editor's <a href="@@audio-track-controls">track headers</a>.
        The meter is shown on the right side area of the header and provides an
        instant, if imprecise, view of the levels on this track/bus.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Limit track header meters to stereo</dfn>: if a track has more than
        two outputs (e.g. with a drum plugin), limits the number of meters in the
        track header to the first two ones. Only affects audio meters, not MIDI.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>MIDI Regions</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Display first MIDI bank/program as 0</dfn>: when patches and bank changes
        are displayed in the editor, if this option is checked, the numbering will
        be zero-based instead of one-based, i.e. banks/programs will be numbered
        O, 1 ,2&hellip; instead of 1, 2, 3&hellip;
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Don't display periodic (MTC, MMC) SysEx messages in MIDI Regions</dfn>:
        if checked, will hide these control messages from the MIDI regions for better
        legibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show velocity horizontally inside notes</dfn>: when on, each note
        of a MIDI region (in <em>Sustained</em> mode) displays its velocity
        (0-127) with a darker fill proportional to its value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Use colors to show note velocity</dfn>: if checked, makes the
        saturation of the notes color proportional to its velocity, hence making
        a more veloce note more intense in color.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Display note names in track headers</dfn>: allows selecting in
        which scenario Ardour will display note names:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Always</em> — Ardour will always try to display note names
            regardless of whether they are available through a MIDNAM file.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>When Available</em> — Ardour will only show note names when
            they are provided in a MIDNAM file.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Never</em> — Ardour will never display note names.
          </li>
        </ul>

        reducing CPU requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show waveform clipping</dfn>: when enabled, the waveform
        displayed will show peaks marked in red if they exceed the clip level.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Waveform Clip Level (dBFS)</dfn>: sets the level at which the
        waveform shown in an audio region will be drawn in red to indicate
        clipping. Setting lower than 0.0&nbsp;dBFS can be useful if any tool in
        the audio chain has problems near 0.0&nbsp;dBFS.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Waveform scale</dfn>: when waveforms are shown in audio regions,
        they can be displayed using a <em>linear</em> or a <em>logarithmic</em>
        scale. See <a href="@@waveform-display">Waveform display</a>.
      </li>
      <li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>Colors</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Color Theme</dfn> allows to switch between some presets bundled with
        Ardour, changing both the palette and items colors, hence styling Ardour
        all at once.
      </li>
      <li>
        The table allows to change the color settings in Ardour by acting on three
        parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <dfn>Items</dfn> that allow to choose any color from the palette (see below)
            to color a UI element. Clicking on a color sample in the <strong>Color</strong>
            column bring up the Palette, to choose from.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn>Palette</dfn> that allows to create a set of colors that will be used
            in the UI. Using a palette allows for better consistency, instead of
            picking "free" colors for each UI element. Clicking on a color patch brings
            up a full color selector, to assign this color to this patch of the palette.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn>Transparency</dfn> where possible, allows to select, with a slider,
            the transparency of the UI element, with 0 (slider to the left) being
            fully opaque.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Restore Defaults</dfn> turns all the palette, item colors and transparency
        back to Ardour's default base setting, in case Ardour's appearance has turned
        into a toddler's toy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Use color-palette to assign color for new tracks</dfn>
        enables color-coding of tracks by picking colors from a fixed palette
        and assigning them to regions' backgrounds and, optionally, to
        respective faders of tracks and busses (there is a dedicated setting
        for that). When disabled, all regions (and faders) have a neutral gray
        background.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Use color-palette to assign color for new busses</dfn> does the
        same as the setting above, but with regards to busses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Use color-palette to assign color for new VCA</dfn> does the same
        as the setting above, but with regards to VCAs.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
 
<h3 id="preferences-appearance-quirks">Quirks</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>Various Workarounds for Windowing Systems</dfn>: As Ardour is available
    on a number of platforms and windowing systems, some specific workarounds are
    sometimes required to provide a smooth experience to the user.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Use visibility information provided by your Window Manager/Desktop</dfn>
        allows the system window manager's rules for the windows visibility to
        supersede Ardour's.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show/Hide splash screen instead of setting z-axis stack order</dfn>:
        Hides the splash instead of re-layering it. This setting requires a restart
        of Ardour to take effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>All floating windows are dialogs</dfn>: when enabled, Ardour will
        use type &quot;Dialog&quot; for all floating windows instead of using type
        &quot;Utility&quot; for some of them. This may help usability with some
        window managers. This setting requires a restart of Ardour to take effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Transient windows follow front window.</dfn>: when enabled,
        transient windows will follow the front window when toggling between the
        editor and mixer. This setting requires a restart of Ardour to take effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Float detached monitor-section window</dfn>: as the
        <a href="@@monitor-section">monitor section</a> can be detached from
        the mixer, this option makes it a floating window, which may be handled
        differently by the windowing system and easier to access.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Allow to resize Engine Dialog</dfn>: allow to resize the engine
        dialog window to work around a bug on some XWayland systems that render
        this dialog as blank.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h3 id="preferences-appearance-translation">Translation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>Internationalization</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Use translations</dfn> sets if Ardour should use a translated
        version of all the messages. The default (unchecked) is English (US). When
        checked, and if a language file exists for the system language, this file
        will be used to translate Ardour.

  <li>
    <dfn>Region Information</dfn>      
    <ul>
      <li>
          <dfn>Show xrun markers in regions</dfn> puts a marker on the region(s)
          while recording, when a buffer over/underflow happens.
        </li>      
        <li>
          <dfn>Show cue markers in regions</dfn> determines if cue markers,
          that are bounded to regions, are displayed or not.
        </li>  
        <li>
          <dfn>Show gain envelopes in audio regions:</dfn> sets in which
          <a href="@@toolbox">modes</a> the gain envelope is displayed in audio regions.
          The gain envelope is superimposed over the region in the selected modes, and
          hidden otherwise for a better legibility.

<h2 id="preferences-editor">Editor</h2>
     
<ul>
  <li>
	<dfn>Scroll and Zoom Behaviors</dfn>      
	<ul>   
      <li>
        <dfn>Zoom to mouse position when zooming with scroll wheel</dfn>: by default,
        Ardour zooms to the <a href="@@edit-point-control">edit point</a>. When this
        option is checked, and the zoom is done with <kbd class="mod1n"></kbd> + mousewheel,
        the zoom will happen at the mouse cursor position regardless of the edit point
        chosen.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Zoom with vertical drag in rulers</dfn> allows, when checked, to click
        anywhere in an empty zone of the <a href="@@ruler">ruler</a> zone and drag
        up to zoom in or down to zoom out.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Double click zooms to selection</dfn> allows by double clicking, to zoom
        on the selection, both on the time and tracks axes. If the selection has been
        done with <kbd class="mod1n"></kbd> or <kbd class="mod3n"></kbd>, then this
        key should still be pressed when double clicking for this to work, otherwise
        the first click breaks the group selection.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Update editor window during drags of the summary</dfn>: when
        enabled the contents of the editor window will redraw the tracks area
        as the selection rectangle in the <a href="@@summary">summary</a> area is
        moved or resized.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Auto-scroll editor window when dragging near its edges</dfn>
        when enabled will scroll the editor window automatically when dragging a
        region. This can make it easier to see where to position the region.
      </li>    
      <li>
        <dfn>Auto-scroll speed when dragging playhead:</dfn> chooses how fast the canvas
        scrolls when dragging the playhead outside of the visible canvas.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Limit zoom &amp; summary view beyond session extents to:</dfn>
        prevents the zoom out both in the editor and the summary, to show anything past
        the chosen time after the end marker, restraining the vision to only useful
        content.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
	<dfn>Editor Behaviour</dfn>      
	<ul>
	  <li>
        <dfn>Move relevant automation when audio regions are moved</dfn>,
        when enabled, causes automation data to stay with a region when the
        region is moved inside the playlist. When disabled, the automation is
        not affected by movement of regions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Ignore Y-axis click position when adding new automation-points</dfn>
        allows to create new automation points at the x-position of the mouse, without
        using the Y-position as the value, hence creating a new automation point at
        its present value.
      </li>
      <li>
    		<dfn>Automation edit cancels auto hide</dfn> determines whether automation
    		lanes that have been automatically shown because of the 
    		<kbd class="option">Edit &gt; Show Automation Lane on Touch</kbd>
    		option should be kept visible if the automation has been touched.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Default fade shape:</dfn> sets which <a href="@@create-region-fades-and-crossfades">
        fade shape</a> is the default.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Regions in edit groups are edited together:</dfn> sets
        the criteria to see if editing actions apply to tracks grouped together
        in an group.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Layering model:</dfn> Ardour allows <a href="@@layering-display">layering</a>
        multiple regions in the same track. This selector defines how these layers are
        managed, either manually or by placing the latest on top.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Split/Separate</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>After a Separate operation, in Range mode:</dfn> determines what
        should become of the Range selection after a Separate operation:
        <ul>
    			<li>Clear the Range Selection: nothing is selected anymore</li>
    			<li>Preserve the Range Selection: the range selection is kept</li>
    			<li>Force-Select the regions under the range: the regions that
		    	were in the range selection are selected in Grab/Object mode</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>After a Split operation, in Object mode:</dfn> determines which,
        if any, regions are selected after a split operation. The options are:
        <ul>
    			<li>Clear the Region Selection: nothing is selected anymore</li>
    			<li>Select only the newly-created regions BEFORE the split point:
    			if regions have been affected by the split, then the regions
    			created by the split before the split point is selected</li>
    			<li>Select only the newly-created regions BEFORE the split point:
    			same as above, for the regions created after the split point</li>
    			<li>Select the newly-created regions: sum of the two above, i.e. all
    			the regions that are created as a result of the split are selected.</li>
    			<li>Preserve the existing selection, AND select all newly-created regions:
    			same as above (all the parts that have been created by the split) plus
    			the unaffected regions that were selected before the split.</li>

<h3 id="preferences-editor-snap">Snap</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
	<dfn>General Snap options</dfn>      :
	<ul>
	  <li>
        <dfn>Snap Threshold (pixels):</dfn> is the maximum distance between
        a snap anchor and an object for Ardour to force the object to be
        placed precisely at that anchor.
      </li> 
	  <li>
        <dfn>Approximate Grid/Ruler granularity (pixels):</dfn> Ardour tries
        to show a reasonable number of grid lines at the current zoom level
        and in the available screen estate. This value tells Ardour what the
        approximate absolute distance between two closest grid lines should
        be, so that it displays the most relevant grid scale to approximately
        fit this distance.
      </li> 
	  <li>
        <dfn>Show "snapped cursor"</dfn> If the Edit point is not the playhead,
        shows the currently selected Edit point as a blue line, to indicate
        where the next editing operation will occur.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Snap rubberband selection to grid</dfn> makes the highlighted 
        zone created by an area selection also snap to grid, i.e. the beginning
        and end of the resulting selecting box will both be grid anchors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Grid switches to alternate selection for Internal Edit Tools</dfn>.
        Two levels of grid mode can coexist in Ardour, one for global regions
        manipulations, and one for finer, in-region editing (e.g. for placing
        MIDI events in a MIDI region). When this option is checked, entering
        Internal Edit mode makes the grid mode switch from one mode to the other.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Rulers automatically change to follow the Grid mode selection</dfn>
        If enabled, changing the Grid mode also makes the relevant
        <a href="@@ruler">ruler</a> visible, while hiding the other ones.
      </li>
    </ul>

<h3 id="preferences-editor-modifiers">Modifiers</h3>

<p>
  This page allows to choose how things are done in the editor. This is a very
  flexible way for Ardour to match an existing workflow, or speed up the editing
  process based on the user's most used actions.

<h2 id="preferences-midi">MIDI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>Session</dfn>
    <ul>
	  <li>
        <dfn>Allow non quarter-note pulse</dfn>: by default, Ardour understands the <a
        href="@@tempo-and-meter">tempo</a> as the number of quarter notes in a minute.
        Checking this option allows to set the tempo based on any division of the note,
        from whole to 1/128th. This is reflected in the <kbd class="menu">Edit
        Tempo</kbd> window (accessed by double clicking a tempo marker) that shows a
        "Pulse" menu when this option is checked.
      </li>	
      <li>
        <dfn>Initial program change:</dfn> Ardour will send a MIDI program
        change message on the <code>ardour:MMC out</code> MIDI port when a session
        is loaded and whenever this field is changed. A value of -1 means don't
        send any program change message.

        <dfn>Sound MIDI notes as they are selected in the editor</dfn> will play
        any selected or added MIDI note when in Draw or Internal Edit modes. The
        note is sent as MIDI as if Ardour was playing it with the session, so the
        processors and signal routing will be applied.

  <li>
    <dfn>Default Visible Note Range</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Default lower visible MIDI note</dfn>: this note will be the lowest
        visible one on the timeline unless you tweak that by adjusting the vertical
        range. E.g. C4 is C on the fourth octave.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Default upper visible MIDI note</dfn>: this note will be the highest
        visible one on the timeline unless you tweak that by adjusting the vertical
        range. E.g. B4 is B on the fourth octave.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Maximum note height</dfn> sets the height of MIDI notes in pixels
        at maximum vertical zoom. Attempting to zoom in closer will result in
        scrolling the pianoroll up or down.

      <li>
        <dfn>MIDI input follows MIDI track selection</dfn> allows Ardour to automatically
        connect the MIDI input to the selected track. Selecting a different MIDI
        track results in Ardour disconnecting the MIDI device from the former track
        and connecting it to the newly selected one, so that the MIDI device is
        always connected to the selected track. Which MIDI device will follow
        selection can be chosen below.

      <li>
        <dfn>Play loop is a transport mode</dfn> changes the behavior of the
        loop button, turning it into a toggle. When enabled, the loop button does
        not start playback but forces playback to always play the loop. Looping
        stays engaged when the transport is stopped. Playback continues where the
        transport stopped and continues to loop. When disabled, the loop button
        starts playing the loop but stop then cancels loop playback.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Loop Fades:</dfn> when the transport moves from the end of the loop
        range back to the beginning, clicks might be audible. This parameter
        allows for adding fades (in, out or cross-) to prevent those clicks.

<h2 id="preferences-plugins">Plugins</h2>

<p class="note">
  The content of this preference page varies heavily between versions or Ardour:
  both the platform and the build-time options can make Ardour support some types
  of plugins and not others. While this documentation tries to show all possible
  options, most systems will only show a subset of the options hereunder, e.g.
  AudioUnits are macOS only&hellip;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>Scan/Discover</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Scan for Plugins</dfn> will initiate an immediate scan of the system
        for available plugins. Useful to get a newly installed plugin recognised
        by Ardour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Scan Time Out</dfn> sets the time that Ardour will try to find
        any plugins in known paths until it gives up.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>General</dfn>
    <ul>
	  <li>
        <dfn>Scan for [new] Plugins on Application Start</dfn> When
    	  enabled new plugins are searched, tested and added to the cache
    	  index on application start. When disabled new plugins will only be
    	  available after triggering a 'Scan' manually.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Always Display Plugin Scan Progress</dfn> When enabled a
        popup window showing plugin scan progress is displayed for indexing
        (cache load) and discovery (detect new plugins).
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Verbose Plugin Scan</dfn>: adds information about the plugin in the
        <a href="@@status-bar">Log window</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Open Plugin manager window when missing plugins are found</dfn>:
        when enabled</b>, the Plugin Manager is displayed at session load if the
        session contains any plugins that are missing, or plugins have been
        updated and require a rescan.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Make new plugins active</dfn>: when enabled, any plugin added to
        a track will be in active mode. If unchecked, the plugins will be added
        in inactive mode by default, hence have no processing effect on the
        track/bus.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Setup Sidechain ports when loading plugin with aux inputs</dfn>:
        when enabled, Ardour will automatically create sidechain ports for
        plugins that have sidechain inputs and leave them for the user
        to connect in the Pin Configuration dialog (see the
        <a href="/signal-routing/sidechaining/">Sidechaining</a> chapter).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>LV1/LV2</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Conceal LADSPA (LV1) Plugins if matching LV2 exists</dfn> When 
        enabled, gives precedence to the LV2 (more up-to-date) version of
        a plugin over its LV1 version, if both exists.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Instrument</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Ask to replace existing instrument plugin</dfn>: if a MIDI track already
        has an instrument (i.e. MIDI to audio converter of some sort) and this
        option is checked, Ardour will detect it and offer to replace the existing
        instrument with the newly added one, avoiding a possible conflict.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Interactively configure instrument plugins on insert</dfn>: when inserting
        a multichannel instrument plugin, if this option is checked, prompts the
        user for the channel configuration for this plugin.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Statistics</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Reset Statistics</dfn>: clears the statistics used to determine
        the most used and most recently used plugins.
      </li>
      <li> 
        <dfn>Plugin chart (use-count) length:</dfn> In the Mixer view's
        <a href="@@favorite-plugins-window">favorite plugins</a> section,
        determines how many plugins are displayed when in <em>Top-10 Plugins</em>
        mode.

  <li>
    <dfn>Plugin GUI</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Automatically open the plugin GUI when adding a new plugin</dfn>
        shows the plugins GUI as soon as it is added to the processing box. If
        unchecked, the plugin will be added in the processor box but the GUI will
        only be shown when <kbd class="mouse">double clicking</kbd> it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show only one plugin window at a time</dfn>: when enabled, only
        one plugin window will be displayed on the screen; when disabled, you
        can open as many plugin windows as you like.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Closing a Plugin GUI Window</dfn>: this allows users deciding how
        Ardour should treat plugin windows aftre closing them. Hiding means a
        complex plugin window can be re-opened fast because it's saved in
        memory, but it uses system resources. Destroying means the window isn't
        saved, which frees up system resources, however some plugins will take
        longer to showup on the screen.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Mixer Strip Inline Display</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show Plugin Inline Display on Mixer strip by default</dfn> allows Ardour
        to show, in the <a href="@@audiomidi-mixer-strips">mixer strips</a>, a
        visual rendering of the effect. These Inline Display are a special feature
        of Ardour, so not all plugins are able to show this display. Most of Ardour's
        <a href="@@bundled-plugins">own plugins</a> have an Inline Display.
        At any time, the plugin's inline display can be toggled on or off by
        <kbd class="mod3n"></kbd>double-clicking it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Don't automatically open the plugin GUI when the plugin has an inline
        display mode</dfn>: this option, available only if
        <kbd class="option">Automatically open the plugin GUI when adding a new plugin</kbd>
        is checked, supercedes it and hides the plugin GUI at creation if it has an
        Inline Display, like Ardour's own <code>ACE *</code> plugins.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Solo controls are Listen controls</dfn>: when enabled, the
    	  soloed track is soloed only on the monitor bus, the master fader mix
    	  is not affected by the solo. This option can also be set by enabling
    	  pre-fader listen or after-fader listen in the <strong>Mixer</strong>

      <li>
        <dfn>I/O Resampler (vari-speed) quality</dfn>: resampling on the fly
        during playback or recording takes time and thus introduces latency.
        This setting accommodates for that and introduces latency predictably
        and consistently. Each preset matches a particular level of resampling

        <dfn>Link panners of Aux and External Sends with main panner by default</dfn>
        when enabled, sends follow the channel panner. When disabled, sends can panned

    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Emphasis on first beat</dfn> plays a different sound when the first

<h2 id="preferences-metering">Metering</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>Metering</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Peak hold time:</dfn> allows the meter to keep displaying the highest
        signal level for a period of time before reverting to showing the actual
        instantaneous value (unless an even higher peak occurs). The longer this
        time is, the easier it is to spot peaks, at the expense of instantaneous
        accuracy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>DPM fall-off:</dfn> describes how fast the Digital Peak Meters can
        go from a high value to a lower one. Faster values are more accurate but
        less readable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Meter line-up level; 0&nbsp;dBu:</dfn> chooses a standard for the
        conversion between dBFS (Full Scale) which represent the numeric signal
        level, and dBu which represents the analog signal level. This value is used
        to configure meter-marks and color knee-points, or set the reference levels
        for various meter-types.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>IEC1/DIN Meter line-up level; 0&nbsp;dBu:</dfn> sets the reference
        level for the IEC1/DIN Meter
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>VU Meter standard:</dfn> selects which standard to use for the zero
        value of the vu-meters, i.e. the analog dBu value that will show as 0 on the
        VU-meter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Peak indicator threshold [dBFS]:</dfn> at that value and over, the
        signal will make the peak meter to turn red, indicating a level too high.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Default Meter Types</dfn> sets the default meters when creating a session
    or track. These meters can be changed afterwards by
    <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd>-clicking a meter.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Default Meter Type for Master Bus:</dfn> defines which kind of
        <a href="@@metering-in-ardour">meter</a> will be used when creating a new
        session (does not apply to the current session).
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Default Meter Type for busses:</dfn> defines which kind of
        meter will be used when creating a new bus (applies to the bus created
        after changing the value).
      </li>
      <li>

    <dfn>Region Analysis</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Enable automatic analysis of audio</dfn> generates the transient
        values (used in e.g. the <a href="@@rhythm-ferret">Rhythm Ferret</a>)
        automatically. When unchecked, the transient values will be generated
        on demand.

<h2 id="preferences-performance">Performance</h2>

<ul>  
  <li>
    <dfn>DSP CPU Utilization</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Signal processing uses:</dfn> sets an upper limit on how many CPU 
        cores or processors can be used to signal processing. By default Ardour uses
        all but one (leaving one core for the GUI, and other tasks).
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Power Management, CPU DMA latency: </dfn> modern processors try
        to aggressively transition to power saving when idle, even for a few
        microseconds, hurting realtime performance by needing to wake to a
        more active state. This setting counters this behaviour by setting
        a maximum response time while low latency operation is desired.
        <kbd class="menu">0</em> is the fastest response time.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>CPU/FPU Denormals</dfn> are a specific type of very small numbers that
    can cause issues with CPU consumption when using some plugins in some
    circumstances. Ardour provides two methods of handling the issue.
    Trying different combinations of these settings may minimize CPU consumption.
    <ul>
      <li>
	      <dfn>Use DC bias to protect against denormals</dfn> adds a small
	      constant value to numbers to move the numbers away from zero.
	    </li>
      <li>
	     	<dfn>Processor handling:</dfn>, if the computer's hardware
	      supports it, offers two methods that can be used individually or
	      combined. Flush to zero and denormals are zero.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Disk I/O Buffering</dfn> settings determine how many seconds of
    audio off of disk will be buffered in memory. Longer settings reduce
    the risk of buffer under-runs but consume more memory.
    <ul>
      <li>
	    <dfn>Preset:</dfn> will automatically choose the values for the playback
        and recording buffer based on the chosen size of the session. The
        <strong>Custom</strong> option allows to manually select the buffers with
        the two sliders below.
      </li>
      <li>
	    <dfn>Playback (seconds of buffering):</dfn> sets how many seconds of
        audio Ardour will buffer during playback.
      </li>
      <li>
	     <dfn>Recording (seconds of buffering):</dfn> sets how many seconds of
         audio Ardour will buffer during recording.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Memory Usage</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Waveform image cache (megabytes):</dfn> sets the maximum amount of ram that
        can be used to store the images representing the waveforms in the editor. Past
        this amount, the images will be regenerated when needed, which can significantly
        decrease the system's performance.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Automation</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
  	    <strong>Thinning factor</strong> ranges from 0 to 1000 with larger
  	    values sending fewer automation changes. Thinning is like lossy
  	    audio compression, removing data that is less likely to be noticed,
  	    although the more is removed, the more likely the loss will be noticed.
  	    The advantage to thinning is reduced CPU usage.
	  </li>
      <li>
  	  	<strong>Automation sampling interval</strong> ranges from 1 to
      	1000&nbsp;ms. Determines how frequently the automation input is
      	sampled. The shorter the interval the higher the accuracy but also
      	the higher the CPU requirements.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
	<dfn>Automatables</dfn>
    <ul>
  	  <li>	  
        <dfn>Limit automatable parameters per plugin</dfn>: as some plugins
        (synthesizers, &hellip;) have a lot of parameters, and those parameters
        can be automated by Ardour, checking this will limit the number of parameters
        that are listed as automatable, hence making the lists shorter and the GUI
        more responsive.
      </li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>Video Server</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show Video Server Startup Dialog</dfn>: when using video inside Ardour,
        this video is accessed via Xjadeo from a source file through a Video Server.
        This options shows the server's startup dialog (useful for debugging a
        malfunctioning video).
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Advanced Setup (remote video server)</dfn> can be used when the setup
        is more complex than opening a local file with Ardour. The tools used behind
        the scene by Ardour allow a lot of flexibility, so for a competent user,
        the options below are provided to access a distant file (i.e. on another
        machine). The default options for the two following fields ("http://localhost:1554"
        and "/") are suitable for local files.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Video Server URL:</dfn> Base URL of the video server delivering the video
        through the network (<code>http://IP-or-address:port</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Video folder</dfn> is the server's local path to the document-root,
        i.e. the files that can be delivered by the server.

  <li>
    <dfn>Video Monitor</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Custom Path to Video Monitor (xjadeo) - leave empty for default:</dfn>
        Ardour bundles offer xjadeo bundled, so it should run flawlessly. Though,
        for custom builds or if a newer version of xjadeo is available, one can
        specify a path to the wanted version of xjadeo.
