    <dfn>DSP CPU Utilization</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Signal processing uses:</dfn> sets how many cpu processors can be
          used to do signal processing. It can be set to use one up to all
          processors.

  <li>
    <dfn>Memory Usage</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Waveform image cache (megabytes):</dfn> sets the maximum amount of ram that
        can be used to store the images representing the waveforms in the editor. Past
        this amount, the images will be regenerated when needed, which can significantly
        decrease the system's performance.

  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Engine</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Try to auto-launch audio/midi engine</dfn> allows Ardour to try to
        automatically launch the audio and MIDI system, driver and device, thus not
        showing the <a href="@@newopen-session-dialog">Audio/MIDI Setup</a> dialog. This
        can save a little time if the system is always used the same way.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Automation</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
    	  <strong>Thinning factor</strong> ranges from 0 to 1000 with larger
    	  values sending fewer automation changes. Thinning is like lossy
    	  audio compression, removing data that is less likely to be noticed,
    	  although the more is removed, the more likely the loss will be noticed.
    	  The advantage to thinning is reduced CPU usage.
	    </li>
      <li>
	  	  <strong>Automation sampling interval</strong> ranges from 1 to
    	  1000&nbsp;ms. Determines how frequently the automation input is
    	  sampled. The shorter the interval the higher the accuracy but also
    	  the higher the CPU requirements.
      </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <dfn>Tempo</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Allow non quarte-note pulse</dfn>: by default, Ardour understands the <a
        href="@@tempo-and-meter">tempo</a> as the number of quarter notes in a minute.
        Checking this option allows to set the tempo based on any division of the note,
        from whole to 1/128th. This is reflected in the <kbd class="menu">Edit
        Tempo</kbd> window (accessed by double clicking a tempo marker) that shows a
        "Pulse" menu when this option is checked.

         <strong>Limit undo history</strong> sets how many commands can be
	       undone using <kbd class="mod1">Z</kbd> or <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Undo</kbd>.
         Unchecking will keep an endless memory of operations to undo, at the
         expense of memory.
      </li>
      <li>
	       <strong>Save undo history</strong> sets how many commands are saved so
	       they are available to be undone after reopening the session. This can
         also be unckecked to keep all actions undoable, at the cost of bigger
         session files.
      </li>
      <li>
	       <strong>Verify removal of last capture</strong> when enabled prompts to
	       verify removal the last recording capture when

  <li>
    <dfn>Session Management</dfn>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Make periodic backups of the session file</strong> will create
        a backup session file after changes to the timeline. The backup file is
        the session name followed by <em>.ardour.bak</em>. The backup can be
        used to recover from crashes when the session had not been explicitly
        saved.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Always copy imported files</strong> selects, and then disables
    	  changes to, the <em>Copy&nbsp;files to&nbsp;session</em> option in the
    	  <a href="@@import-dialog">Add Existing Media</a> dialog.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Default folder for new sessions:</strong> defaults the folder

        with a rubberband rectangle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Prompt for new marker names</dfn> when enabled, popup a dialog
        when a new <a href="@@working-with-markers">marker</a> is created. This allows
        markers to be named as they are created.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Allow dragging of the playhead</dfn>, when enabled, allows
        dragging the playhead with the mouse in the <strong>Editor</strong> window.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Playhead dragging speed (%):</dfn> chooses how fast the canvas

      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Limit zooming &amp; summary view to X minutes beyond session extents</dfn>
        prevents the zoom out both in the editor and the summary, to show anything past
        the chosen time after the end marker, restraining the vision to only usefull
        content.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Zoom to mouse position when zooming with scroll wheel</dfn>: by default,
        Ardour zooms to the <a href="@@edit-point-control">edit point</a>. When this
        option is checked, and the zoom is done with <kbd class="mod1n"></kbd> + mousewheel,
        the zoom will happen at the mouse cursor position regardless of the edit point
        chosen.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Zoom with vertical drag in rulers</dfn> allows, when checked, to click
        anywhere in an empty zone of the <a href="@@ruler">ruler</a> zone and drag
        up to zoom in or down to zoom out.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Double click zooms to selection</dfn> allows by double clicking, to zoom
        on the selection, both on the time and tracks axes. If the selection has been
        done with <kbd class="mod1n"></kbd> or <kbd class="mod3n"></kbd>, then this
        key should still be pressed when double clicking for this to work, otherwise
        the first click breaks the group selection.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Update editor window during drags of the summary</dfn>: when
        enabled the contents of the editor window will redraw the tracks area
        as the selection rectangle in the <a href="@@summary">summary</a> area is
        moved or resized.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Auto-scroll editor window when dragging near its edges</dfn>
        when enabled will scroll the editor window automatically when dragging a
        region. This can make it easier to see where to position the region.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show gain envelopes in audio regions:</dfn> sets in which
        <a href="@@toolbox">modes</a> the gain envelope is displayed in audio regions.
        The gain envelope is superimposed over the region in the selected modes, and
        hidden otherwise for a better legibility.

  <li>
    <dfn>Editor Behaviour</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Move relevant automation when audio regions are moved</dfn>,
        when enabled, causes automation data to stay with a region when the
        region is moved inside the playlist. When disabled, the automation is
        not affected by movement of regions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Ignore Y-axis click position when adding new automation-points</dfn>
        allows to create new automation points at the x-position of the mouse, without
        using the Y-position as the value, hence creating a new automation point at
        its present value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Default fade shape:</dfn> sets which <a href="@@create-region-fades-and-crossfades">
        fade shape</a> is the default.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Regions in edit groups are edited together:</dfn> sets
        the criteria to see if editing actions apply to tracks grouped together
        in an group.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Layering model:</dfn> Ardour allows <a href="@@layering-display">layering</a>
        multiple regions in the same track. This selector defines how these layers are
        managed, either manually or by placing the latest on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>After splitting selected regions, select:</dfn> determines which,
        if any, regions are selected after a split operation. The options are no
        regions, the regions created by the split, and if more than one region
        was selected to start with, the existing selection and the new regions.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    	  available from the <strong>Mixer</strong> monitor section.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Solo-in-place mute cut (dB):</dfn> sets the attenuation of the

        totally muted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Listen Position:</dfn> determines what is listened to when

    <dfn>Track and Bus Connections</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Auto-connect main output (master or monitor) bus to physical ports</dfn>
        auto-connects the outputs to the first N physical ports. In a session without a
        <a href="@@monitor-section">monitor section</a>, the master-bus is
        connected to the system's playback ports, and if a monitor section exists,
        the monitor-bus' output are connected.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Connect track inputs:</dfn> allows to choose when a new track is

        inputs of the system or not (hence the user has to manually connect it).
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Connect track and bus outputs:</dfn> allows to choose, for any new
        track or bus created, whether its output will automatically be connected

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>Buffering</dfn> settings determine how many seconds of audio off of disk
    will be buffered in memory. Longer settings reduce the risk of buffer
    under-runs but consume more memory.
    <ul>
      <li>
	      <dfn>Preset:</dfn> will automatically choose the values for the playback
        and recording buffer based on the chosen size of the session. The

         audio Ardour will buffer during recording.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <dfn>Denormals</dfn> are a specific type of very small numbers that
    can cause issues with CPU consumption when using some plugins in some
    circumstances.
    Ardour provides two methods of handling the issue. Trying different
    combinations of these settings may minimize CPU consumption.
    <ul>
      <li>
	       <dfn>Use DC bias to protect against denormals</dfn> adds a small
	       constant value to numbers to move the numbers away from zero.
	    </li>
      <li>
		     <dfn>Processor handling:</dfn>, if the computer's hardware
	       supports it, offers two methods that can be used individually or
	       combined. Flush to zero and denormals are zero.

        automatically. When unchecked, the transient values will be generated
        on demand.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Replicate missing region channels</dfn>: if a track is N-channel,
        and the region has fewer channels, this option copies the existing
        channel's data for this non-existant one. If left unckecked, the missing
        channels will stay silent.

      <li>
        <dfn>MIDI read-ahead time (seconds):</dfn> defines how much time of MIDI data
        must be read in advance by Ardour and put in the buffer. More time means more
        stability while playing back, at the expense of more time to buffer the data.
        This should be set to a low value for a reasonably capable machine.
      </li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Peak hold time:</dfn> allows the meter to keep displaying the highest
        signal level for a period of time before reverting to showing the actual
        instantaneous value (unless an even higher peak occurs). The longer this
        time is, the easier it is to spot peaks, at the expense of instantaneous
        accuracy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>DPM fall-off:</dfn> describes how fast the Digital Peak Meters can
        go from a high value to a lower one. Faster values are more accurate but
        less readable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Meter line-up level; 0&nbsp;dBu:</dfn> chooses a standard for the
        conversion between dBFS (Full Scale) which represent the numeric signal
        level, and dBu which represents the analog signal level. This value is used
        to configure meter-marks and color knee-points, or set the reference levels
        for various meter-types.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>IEC1/DIN Meter line-up level; 0&nbsp;dBu:</dfn> sets the reference

      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>VU Meter standard:</dfn> selects which standard to use for the zero
        value of the vu-meters, i.e. how manu analog dBu are considered 0 on the
        VU-meter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Peak indicator threshold [dBFS]:</dfn> at that value and over, the

<h2 id="transport">Transport</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>General</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Stop at the end of the session</dfn> causes the transport to
        stop during playback when it reaches the end marker. Behavior during
        recording is not changed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Keep record-enable engaged on stop</dfn> leaves the global
        record-enable engaged after transport is stopped.  Does not affect track
        level record-enable which is never changed on stop.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Disable per-track record disarm while rolling</dfn>, when
        enabled, will not allow the any track's record-enable to be disarmed
        during record, preventing accidentally stopping the recording of a take.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>12dB gain reduction during fast-forward and fast-rewind</dfn>
        when enabled will reduce the unpleasant increase in perceived volume
        that occurs when fast-forwarding or rewinding through some kinds of audio.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Preroll:</dfn> sets the duration of the preroll for playing and
        recording when using a preroll. Can be a musical duration (in bars) or a
        duration in seconds.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <dfn>Looping</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Play loop is a transport mode</dfn> changes the behavior of the
        loop button, turning it into a toggle. When enabled, the loop button does
        not start playback but forces playback to always play the loop. Looping
        stays engaged when the transport is stopped. Playback continues where the
        transport stopped and continues to loop. When disabled, the loop button
        starts playing the loop but stop then cancels loop playback.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Do seamless looping</dfn> removes any clicks that might
        otherwise be audible when the transport moves from the end of the loop
        range back to the beginning.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <dfn>Dropout (xrun) Handling</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Stop recording when an xrun occurs</dfn> will stop the transport
        when an xrun occurs during recording, ensuring no audible glitches are
        recorded.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Create markers where xruns occur</dfn> will create a new
        <a href="@@working-with-markers">marker</a> when an xrun occurs during
        recording at the location of the xrun. This marks where possible xruns
        might produce audible glitches.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sync">Sync</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>External Synchronization</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>External timecode source</dfn> determines which external source to
        use when Ardour is using an external
        <a href="@@working-with-synchronization">synchronization</a> source.
        Depending on the timecode source chosen, the additional preference options
        below are available.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Match session video frame rate to external timecode</dfn>
  	    controls the value of the video frame rate <em>while chasing</em>
  	    an external timecode source. When enabled, the session video frame rate will be
        changed to match that of the selected external timecode source. When disabled,
        the session video frame rate will not be changed to match that of the selected
        external timecode source. Instead, the frame rate indication in the main clock
        will flash red and Ardour will convert between the external timecode standard
        and the session standard.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Sync-lock timecode to clock (disable drift compensation)</dfn>
  	    When enabled, Ardour will never varispeed when slaved to external
  	    timecode. Sync Lock indicates that the selected external timecode
  	    source shares clock-sync (Black &amp; Burst, Wordclock, etc) with
  	    the audio interface. This options disables drift compensation.
  	    The transport speed is fixed at 1.0. Vari-speed LTC will be ignored
  	    and cause drift. When disabled, Ardour will compensate for potential
        drift regardless if the timecode sources shares clock sync.
  	  </li>
  	  <li>
  	    <dfn>Lock to 29.9700 fps instead of 30000/1001</dfn>, when
  	    enabled, will force Ardour to assume the external timecode source
  	    uses 29.97 fps instead of 30000/1001.
  	    SMPTE 12M-1999 specifies 29.97&nbsp;df as 30000/1001. The spec
  	    further mentions that drop-frame timecode has an accumulated error
  	    of -86&nbsp;ms over a 24&nbsp;hour period. Drop-frame timecode would
  	    compensate exactly for an NTSC color frame rate of 30 &times; 0.9990 (i.e.
  	    29.970000). That is not the actual rate. However, some vendors use
  	    that rate&mdash;despite it being against the specs&mdash;because the
  	    variant of using exactly 29.97&nbsp;fps has zero timecode drift.

        not moving.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>LTC generator level [dBFS]:</dfn> specifies the peak volume of

        <dfn>MIDI input follows MIDI track selection</dfn> allows Ardour to automatically
        connect the MIDI input to the selected track. Selecting a different MIDI
        track results in Ardour disconnecting the MIDI device from the former track
        and connecting it to the newly selected one, so that the MIDI device is

<h2 id="plugins">Plugins</h2>

<p class="note">
  The content of this preference page varies heavily between versions or Ardour:
  both the platform and the build-time options can make Ardour support some types
  of plugins and not others. While this documentation tries to show all possible

        (cache load) and discovery (detect new plugins).
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Silence plugins when the transport is stopped</dfn> when stopping
        playback or recording, if this option is checked, the plugins that still
        emit sound (reverbs, etc&hellip;) will be stopped. If unchecked, the plugins
        will continue playing after the transport stop.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Make new plugins active</dfn> when enabled, any plugin added to a track
        will be in active mode. If unchecked, the plugins will be added in inactive
        mode by default, hence have no processing effect on the track/bus.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Limit automatable parameters per plugin</dfn>: as some plugins
        (synthesizers, &hellip;) have a lot of parameters, and those parameters
        can be automated by Ardour, checking this will limit the number of parameters
        that are listed as automatable, hence making the lists shorter and the GUI
        more responsive.

      <li>
        <dfn>Show Plugin Inline Display on Mixestrip by default</dfn> allows Ardour
        to show, in the <a href="@@audiomidi-mixer-strips">mixer strips</a>, a
        visual rendering of the effect. These Inline Display are a special feature
        of Ardour, so not all plugins are able to show this display. Most of Ardour's
        <a href="@@plugins-bundled-with-ardour">own plugins</a> have an Inline Display.
        At any time, the plugin's Inline Display can be toggled on or off by

      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Don't automatically open the plugin GUI when the plugin has an inline
        display mode</dfn>: this option, available only if
        <kbd class="option">Automatically open the plugin GUI when adding a new plugin</kbd>

  <li>
    <dfn>Instrument</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Ask to replace existing instrument plugin</dfn>: if a MIDI track already
        has an instrument (i.e. MIDI to audio converter of some sort) and this
        option is checked, Ardour will detect it and offer to replace the existing
        instrument with the newly added one, avoiding a possible conflict.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Interactively configure instrument plugins on insert</dfn>: when inserting

        hardware acceleration, improving stability and responsiveness on those
        buggy systems.

  <li>
    <dfn>Graphical User Interface</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Highlight widgets on mouseover</dfn>, when checked, makes Ardour's
        widgets (buttons, sliders, &hellip;) slightly change color when the mouse
        hovers them, visually indicating what a mouse action would interact with.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show tooltips if mouse hovers over a control</dfn> when checked,
        displays a little help bubble about the control the mouse hovers. The mouse
        pointer needs to stay idle for about 1 sec for the tooltip to appear.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Update clocks at TC Frame rate</dfn>: Ardour updates its clocks every
        100&nbsp;ms. Checking this will make the clock refresh at every TimeCode
        frame which is more responsive, at the cost of a bit more system stress.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Blink Rec-Arm buttons</dfn>: when enabled, the record-armed
        buttons on tracks will blink when they are armed but not currently recording.
        When disabled, the record-armed buttons on tracks will be outlined in red
        instead of blinking. The global record-arm button in the
        <a href="@@transport-bar">Transport bar</a> is unaffected.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Blink Alert indicators</dfn>: when enabled, the Alert indicators (like
        the <kbd class="menu">Error Log</kbd> or the <kbd class="menu">Feedback</kbd>
        button) will blink when they are active (when resp. an error or a feedback
        has been detected) When disabled, the indicators will turn red instead of
        blinking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>GUI and Font scaling:</dfn> allows the display size of most of the
        text and buttons in the user interface to be scaled up or down. May

  <li>
    <dfn>General</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Use name highlight bars in region displays (requires a restart)</dfn>:
        when enabled, the region name is displayed, in the editor, in its own opaque bar
        at the bottom of the region. When disabled, the region name is overlayed
        at the top of the region, possibly over audio waveforms or MIDI notes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Region color follows track color</dfn>: when enabled,
        the background color of regions in the editor will be displayed using the
        the color assigned to the track. When disabled the default region
        background color will be used.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <dfn>Waveforms</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show waveforms in regions</dfn> when enabled shows a visual
        representation of the region's audio waveform.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show waveform while recording</dfn> when
        enabled, will draw the audio waveform in regions being recorded, in near
        real time. When disabled, only a region block will be drawn while recording,
        reducing CPU requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show waveform clipping</dfn>: when enabled the waveform
        displayed will show peaks marked in red if they exceed the clip level.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Waveform Clip Level (dBFS):</dfn> sets the level at which the
        waveform shown in an audio region will be drawn in red to indicate
        clipping. Setting lower than 0.0&nbsp;dBFS can be useful if any tool in
        the audio chain has problems near 0.0&nbsp;dBFS.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Waveform scale:</dfn> when waveforms are shown in audio regions,
        they can be displayed using a <em>linear</em> or a <em>logarithmic</em>
        scale. See <a href="@@waveform-display">Waveform display</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Waveform shape:</dfn> when waveforms are shown in audio regions,
        they can be displayed using a <em>traditional</em> or a <em>rectified</em>
        shape. See <a href="@@waveform-display">Waveform display</a>.
      </li>

  <li>
    <dfn>Editor Meters</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show meters in track headers</dfn>, when enabled, shows
        a small meter in the Editor's <a href="@@audio-track-controls">track headers</a>.
        The meter is shown on the right side area of the header and provides an
        instant, if unprecise, view of the levels on this track/bus.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Limit track header meters to stereo</dfn>: if a track has more than
        two outputs (e.g. with a drum plugin), limits the number of meters in the
        track header to the first two ones. Only affects audio meters, not MIDI.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <dfn>MIDI Regions</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Display first MIDI bank/program as 0</dfn>: when patches and bank changes
        are displayed in the editor, if this option is checked, the numbering will
        be zero-based instead of one-based, i.e. banks/programs will be numbered
        O, 1 ,2&hellip; instead of 1, 2, 3&hellip;
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Don't display periodic (MTC, MMC) SysEx messages in MIDI Regions</dfn>:
        if checked, will hide these control messages from the MIDI regions for better
        legibility.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Draw &quot;flat&quot; buttons</dfn>: when enabled, button controls
        in the user interface will be drawn with a flat look. When disabled button
        controls will have a slight 3D appearance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>LED meter style</dfn> if checked, the bar meters in the editor and
        mixer will be styled to look like if they were made of LEDs, with a dotted
        bar. Unckeking this option makes the bars flat and continuous.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Waveforms color gradient depth:</dfn> determines how much gradient
        effect is applied to the inner of audio waveforms displayed in the editor.
        Values range from 0.0, no gradient effect, to 1.0, maximum effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Timeline item gradient depth:</dfn> Determines how much

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>Colors</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Color Theme</dfn> allows to switch between some presets bundled with
        Ardour, changing both the palette and items colors, hence styling Ardour
        all at once.
      </li>
      <li>
        The table allows to change the color settings in Ardour by acting on three
        parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <dfn>Items</dfn> that allow to choose any color from the palette (see below)
            to color a UI element. Clicking on a color sample in the <strong>Color</strong>
            column bring up the Palette, to choose from.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn>Palette</dfn> that allows to create a set of colors that will be used
            in the UI. Using a palette allows for better consistency, instead of
            picking "free" colors for each UI element. Clicking on a color patch brings
            up a full color selector, to assign this color to this patch of the palette.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn>Transparency</dfn> where possible, allows to select, with a slider,
            the transparency of the UI element, with 0 (slider to the left) being
            fully opaque.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Restore Defaults</dfn> turns all the palette, item colors and transparency
        back to Ardour's default base setting, in case Ardour's appearance has turned
        into a toddler's toy.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="quirks">Quirks</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <dfn>Various Workarounds for Windowing Systems</dfn>: As Ardour is available
    on a number of platforms and windowing systems, some specific workarounds are
    sometimes required to provide a smooth experience to the user.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Use visibility information provided by your Window Manager/Desktop</dfn>
        allows the system window manager's rules for the windows visibility to
        superseed Ardour's.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>All floating windows are dialogs</dfn>: when enabled, Ardour will
        use type &quot;Dialog&quot; for all floating windows instead of using type
        &quot;Utility&quot; for some of them. This may help usability with some
        window managers. This setting requires a restart of Ardour to take effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Transient windows follow front window.</dfn>: when enabled,
        transient windows will follow the front window when toggling between the
        editor and mixer. This setting requires a restart of Ardour to take effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Float detached monitor-section window</dfn>: as the <a href="@@monitor-section">
        monitor section</a> can be detached from the mixer, this option makes it a
        floating window, which may be handled differently by the windowing system
        and easier to access.
      </li>
    </ul>

        when exporting a video about licencing and offers to open the
        <a href="@@workflow-amp-operations#export">export video</a> section of
        this manual.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Show Video Server Startup Dialog</dfn>: when using video inside Ardour,
        this video is accessed via Xjadeo from a source file through a Video Server.
        This options shows the server's startup dialog (usefull for degbugging a
        malfunctionning video).
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Advanced Setup (remote video server)</dfn> can be used when the setup
        is more complex than opening a local file with Ardour. The tools used behind
        the scene by Ardour allow a lot of flexibility, so for a competent user,
        the options below are provided to access a distant file (i.e. on another
        machine). The default options for the two following fields ("http://localhost:1554"
        and "/") are suitable for local files.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Video Server URL:</dfn> Base URL of the video server delivering the video
        through the network (<code>http://IP-or-adress:port</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>Video folder</dfn> is the server's local path to the document-root,
        i.e. the files that can be delivered by the server.

  <li>
    <dfn>Video Monitor</dfn>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn>Custom Path to Video Monitor (xjadeo) - leave empty for default:</dfn>
        Ardour bundles offer xjadeo bundled, so it should run flawlessly. Though,
        for custom builds or if a newer version of xjadeo is available, one can
        specify a path to the wanted version of xjadeo.
