<p>
  The <kbd class="window">Quick Audio Export</kbd> dialog is a trimmed-down
  version of its original counterpart. It's best for cases when all the user
  needs is exporting an entire session (or part of it) to something like a WAV
  file at the session rate.

<p>
  The three available options are:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr>
  	<th>Format preset</th>
  	<td>Lists popular options such as FLAC, WAV @ session rate, MP3, and others.
  	</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<th>Export range</th>
  	<td>Allows choosing between exporting a selection (range), the entire
  	session (from session start marker to session end marker), or ranges
    defined by range markers. If neither selection nor range markers are
    available, only the entire session can be exported.
  </td></tr>
  <tr>
  	<th>After export</th>
  	<td>Allows choosing whether to open the folder where the audio file has been
  	exported to, or do nothing.
  </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  Ongoing export can be canceled by pressing the
  <kbd class="button">Abort</kbd> button.
