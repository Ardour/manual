<p>
  The <kbd class="window">Quick Audio Export</kbd> dialog is a trimmed-down
  version of its original counterpart. It's best for cases when all the user
  needs is exporting an entire session (or part of it) to something like a WAV
  file at the session rate.

  The three available options are:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr>
  	<th>Format preset</th>
  	<td>Lists popular options such as FLAC, WAV @ session rate, MP3, and others.
  	</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<th>Export range</th>
  	<td>Allows choosing between exporting a selection (range) or the entire
  	session (from session start marker to session end marker). Only lists the
  	latter option if no selection is available.
  </td></tr>
  <tr>
  	<th>After export</th>
  	<td>Allows choosing whether to open the folder where the audio file has been
  	exported to, or do nothing.
  </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  Ongoing export can be canceled by pressing the
  <kbd class="button">Abort</kbd> button.
