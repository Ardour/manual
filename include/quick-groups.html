<p>
	Having a persistent group of tracks and/or busses has a number of pros,
	such as being able to control faders of multiple tracks at once, at any
	moment in time. However, Ardour also supports "quick" temporary groups.
</p>

<p>
	Selecting multiple tracks or busses either in the Editor or in the Mixer
	window allows treating those tracks and/or busses as a group as long as
	the tracks/busses are selected. This means:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Adjusting fader position in one track/bus will change faders' positions
		of other selected tracks/busses by the same amount. The same applies
		to input trim changes.
	</li>
	<li>
		Toggling Solo, Mute, Rec-enable, Solo Safe, Solo Isolate, Monitoring
		controls in one track/bus will toggle the same type of control in other
		selected tracks/busses.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If one of the selected tracks/busses belongs to a persistent group,
	selecting it will automatically all the other members of that persistent
	group and affect respective controls there as well. This can be worked around
	by opening group's setting and changing what controls are shared in the group.
</p>

<p>
	There are two cases where quick groups will not work as expected:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		When a change to a control in a selected track/bus comes from a hardware
		control surface.
	</li>
	<li>
		When you use the mouse scroll wheel to adjust faders
		(this is a temporary limitation).
	</li>
</ol>
