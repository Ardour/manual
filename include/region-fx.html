<p>
	With Ardour, it's possible to apply effects to separate regions rather than entire tracks. The effect and its automation remain with the region, even when it is moved around on the timeline.
</p>

<p>
	Applying effects directly to regions on the timeline is convenient for many workflows. The given effect is rendered into memory and does not add any additional DSP load during playback.
</p>

<p>
	The controls for region FX are available in the bottom pane when it's enabled and the region properties dialog (<kbd class="menu">Region &gt; Properties</kbd> in the menu).

<h2>Adding a region effect</h2>
