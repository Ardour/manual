<p><dfn>Region names</dfn> are initially derived from either</p>
<ul>
  <li>the name of the playlist for which they were recorded,</li>
  <li>the name of the track for which they were recorded, or</li>
  <li>the name of the embedded/imported file they represent.</li>
</ul>
<p class="fixme">
  It appears that recorded regions are always named after the track, not the
  active playlist in that track.
</p>

<h2>Whole File Region Names</h2>
<p>
  These are not audio files, but regions that represent the full extent of an
  audio file. Every time a new recording is done, or a new file is imported
  to the session, a new region is created that represents the <dfn>entire audio
  file</dfn>. This region will have the name of the track/playlist/original file,
  followed by a "-", then a number plus a dot and then a number.
</p>
<p>
  For <dfn>recorded regions</dfn>, the number will increase each time a new recording
  is made. So, for example, if there is a playlist called
  <samp>Didgeridoo</samp>, the
  first recorded whole file region for that playlist will be called
  <samp>Digderidoo-1</samp>. The next one will be <samp>Digeridoo-2</samp> and so on.
</p>
<p>
  For <dfn>imported regions</dfn>, the region name will be based on the original file
  name, but with any final suffix (e.g. ".wav" or ".aiff") removed.
</p>
<p>
  Normally, whole file regions are not inserted into tracks or playlists,
  but regions derived from them are. The whole-file versions live in the
  editor region list where they act as an organizing mechanism for regions
  that are derived from them.
</p>

<h2>Normal Region Names</h2>
<p>
  When a region is inserted into a track and playlist, its initial name will
  end in a <dfn>version number</dfn>, such as <samp>.1</samp>. For a recorded region,
  if the whole file region was <samp>Hang drum-1</samp>, then the region in
  the track will appear with the name <samp>Hang drum-1.1</samp>. For an
  imported region, if the whole file region was <samp>Bach:Invention3</samp>,
  then the region in the track will appear with the name
  <samp>Bach:Invention3.1</samp>.
</p>

<h2>Copied Region Names</h2>
<p>
  If you <dfn>copy a region</dfn>, it initially shares the same name as the original.
  When you perform an operation modifies one of the copies, Ardour will
  increment the version number on the particular copy that changed.
</p>

<h2>Renaming Regions</h2>
<p>
  You can <dfn>rename a region</dfn> at any time. Use the region context menu to
  pop up the <kbd class="menu">Rename</kbd> dialog. The new name does not need to
  have a version number in it (in fact, it probably should not). Ardour will add a
  version number in the future if needed (e.g. if you copy or split the region).
