<p><dfn>Region names</dfn> are initially derived from either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the name of the track for which they were recorded, or</li>
  <li>the name of the embedded/imported file they represent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Whole File Region Names</h2>
<p>
  These are not audio files, but regions that represent the full extent of an
  audio file. Every time a new recording is done, or a new file is imported
  to the session, a new region is created that represents the <dfn>entire audio
  file</dfn>. This region will have the name of the track/playlist/original file,
  followed by a "-", then a number plus a dot and then a number.
</p>
<p>
  For <dfn>recorded regions</dfn>, the number will increase each time a new recording
  is made. So, for example, if there is a track called
  <samp>Didgeridoo</samp>, the
  first recorded whole file region for that playlist will be called
  <samp>Digderidoo-1</samp>. The next one will be <samp>Digeridoo-2</samp> and so on.
</p>
<p>
  For <dfn>imported regions</dfn>, the region name will be based on the original file
  name, but with any final suffix (e.g. ".wav" or ".aiff") removed.
</p>
<p>
  Normally, whole file regions are not inserted into tracks or playlists,
  but regions derived from them are. The whole-file versions live in the
  <a href="@@the-region-list">Editor's region list</a> where they act as an
  organizing mechanism for regions that are derived from them.
</p>

<h2>Normal Region Names</h2>
<p>
  When a region is inserted into a track and playlist, its initial name will
  end in a <dfn>version number</dfn>, such as <samp>.1</samp>. For a recorded region,
  if the whole file region was <samp>Hang drum-1</samp>, then the region in
  the track will appear with the name <samp>Hang drum-1.1</samp>. For an
  imported region, if the whole file region was <samp>Bach:Invention3</samp>,
  then the region in the track will appear with the name
  <samp>Bach:Invention3.1</samp>.
</p>

<h2>Copied Region Names</h2>
<p>
  Duplicating or splitting a region creates new region(s) that
  are based on the same original files. Hence, they share the same base name (in the
  example above, <samp>Hang drum-1</samp>), but their version number will be incremented
  each time. Duplicating <samp>Hang drum-1.4</samp> by <kbd class="mod1 mouse">left</kbd>
  dragging it will create a new region called <samp>Hang drum-1.5</samp>. Splitting
  <samp>Hang drum-1.5</samp> by hitting the <kbd>S</kbd> key will remove the
  <samp>Hang drum-1.5</samp> region and create two shorter regions named
  <samp>Hang drum-1.6</samp> and <samp>Hang drum-1.7</samp>.
</p>

<h2>Renaming Regions</h2>
<p>
  Regions can be renamed at any time using the region context menu : <kbd class="menu">
  <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd> click &gt; <em>name_of_the_region</em> &gt; Rename... </kbd>.
  The new name does not need to have a version number in it (in fact, it probably
  should not). Ardour will add a version number in the future if needed (e.g.
  if the region is copied or sliced).
