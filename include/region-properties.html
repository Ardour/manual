<p>
  The <dfn>Region properties</dfn> window brings information about the selected
  regions, and allows to fine tune its sequencing. It is accessed through the
  <kbd class="menu">Region &gt; Properties&hellip;</kbd> menu, or by
  <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd> clicking the region,
  <kbd class="menu"><i>Name_of_the_Region</i> &gt; Properties&hellip;</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
  This window also allows to manually set the different values.

  All the fields marked as "editable" in the table above allow the user to manually
  enter a value in the field, to manually set this value.

<p>
  <kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd>-clicking on a field allow to switch between the
  different <a href="@@editing-clocks">clock modes</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The context menu that pops up also allows the relevant fields (Position, End,
  and both Sync points) to be set from the playhead location, which can be used to
  e.g. trim a region to the playhead or place a sync point exactly on a beat.
