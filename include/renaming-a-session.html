  Use <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Rename</kbd> to give your session a new name. A dialog will appear to ask you for the new name.
</p>

<p>
  This operation does <strong>not</strong> make a new session folder&mdash;the existing session folder and relevant contents are renamed. If your session was not saved before a rename operation, it will be saved automatically and then renaming will continue.
</p>

<p class="warning">
  Ardour's <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Save As</kbd> operation will not make a new copy of the session folder and its contents. All it does is create a new session file.
