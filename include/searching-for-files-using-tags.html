<p>
  A <dfn>tag</dfn> is bit of information, or metadata, that is associated 
  with a data file. Specifically, tags are keywords or terms that you feel 
  have some relevance to a particular soundfile. Ardour can store these tags 
  in a searchable <dfn>database</dfn> so that you can quickly search for sounds based 
  on the tags that you have assigned to them. 
</p>
<p>
  For example you can assign the term <kbd class="input">120bpm</kbd> to a 
  sound, and then when you search for this tag, the file will appear in the
  search list. Tags are independent of the filename or anything else about 
  the file. Tags, and the file paths that they are associated with, are 
  stored in a file called <samp>sfdb</samp> in your Ardour user folder.
</p>
<p>
  To <dfn>add tags</dfn> to a given file, open the <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Import</kbd> 
  dialog, select the file in the browser, and type new tags into tag area in
  the soundfile information box on the right.<br/>
  Tags are stored when the input box loses focus, there is no need to
  explicitly save them.
</p>
<p>
  You can <dfn>search</dfn> for specific tags in the <kbd
  class="menu">Search Tags</kbd> tab of the same dialog. Files which have 
  been tagged with the relevant terms will appear in the results window. 
  Selected files can be auditioned and marked with additional tags if
  required.
