	Sections represent significant self-contained parts of the timeline.
	Common examples of a section are a verse, a chorus, or a bridge in a song.
</p>

<p>
	Currently, sections are exposed as editor actions that are available
	when a range is selected on the timeline:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Cut/Paste Range Section to Edit Point
	</li>
	<li>
		Copy/Paste Range Section to Edit Point
	</li>
	<li>
		Delete Range Section
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	When Ardour treats a range as a section, it cuts or copies audio and MIDI
	data and their automation (hidden or visible) across all tracks, as well
	as markers and unused playlists. When pasting the cut or copied data, it
	ripples all tracks at the edit point. It's also possible to repeatedly
	copy and paste an existing section.
