<p>
  Many editing operations in Ardour require to first <dfn>select one or more
  regions</dfn> to change them in some way. A single region,
  or multiple regions can be selected, including regions in different tracks. When
  a region is selected, it will appear in a darker color than unselected regions.
</p>
<p>
  If a track is a member of a group that is active and has the
  <kbd class="option">Select</kbd> property enabled, then Ardour will attempt to
  match whatever selections is made in one track across every other track of the
  group. See <a href="@@corresponding-regions-selection">Corresponding
  Regions Selection</a> for more information on precisely how selections will be
  propagated to other tracks.
</p>

<h2>Region Selection and Track Selection</h2>
<p>
  Please read <a href="@@selecting-tracks">Region &amp; Track Selection</a>
  for more information on how selecting regions and selecting tracks interact.
</p>

<h2>Selecting a Region</h2>
<p>
  Using the <a href="@@toolbox">Grab Mode tool</a>, <kbd class="mouse">left</kbd>
  clicking on a region selects it. If <a href="@@toolbox">Smart mode</a> is
  enabled, the lower half of the region must be clicked.
</p>

<h2>Deselecting a Region</h2>
<p>
  Still using the <a href="@@toolbox">Grab Mode tool</a>, <kbd class="mouse mod1">Left</kbd>-clicking the region deselects it. If
  <a href="@@toolbox">Smart mode</a> is enabled, the lower half of the region must be clicked.
</p>
<p>
  Note that a <kbd class="mouse mod1">left</kbd> click simply toggles the
  selected status of an object, so it can be used to select unselected regions
  too.
</p>

<h2>Selecting Multiple Regions in a Track</h2>
<p>This can be achieved in different ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li><kbd class="mouse mod1">Left</kbd>-clicking each region.</li>
  <li>Dragging a rubberband box from an empty point in a track before the first
    region to select to a point within or after the last region to select. Using
    <kbd class="mouse mod1">left</kbd>-drag allows doing it multiple times.</li>
  <li>If the regions are all adjacent to one another, clicking the first region
    to select, then <kbd class="mouse mod3">Left</kbd>-clicking the last one.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Selecting All Regions in a Track</h2>
<p>
  The <kbd class="menu">Select &gt; Select All In Track</kbd> option in the context menu
  (<kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd> click on the track) selects all the regions in the track at once.
</p>
<p>
  See the <a href="@@track-context-menu">Track Context Menu</a>
  for more information on other per-track selection operations that are available.
</p>

<h2>Selecting Multiple Regions Across Different Tracks</h2>
<p>
  This can be achieved by a <kbd class="mouse mod1">left</kbd>-click or <kbd class="mouse
  mod3">Left</kbd>-click on the regions to select.
</p>

<h2>Selecting a Region From the Region List</h2>
<p>
  Clicking the name of the region in the <a href="@@the-region-list">Region List</a>.
  selects it. This will do nothing for whole-file regions, since they do not exist
  anywhere in a playlist or track.
</p>
