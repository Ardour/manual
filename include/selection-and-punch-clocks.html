<p>
  The current <dfn>selection range</dfn>, as set with the <a href="@@toolbox">Range Mode tool</a>,
  is displayed in these three clocks: start of the range, end of the range, and length.
</p>
<p>
  Clicking on the range clocks will locate to either the beginning or end of the punch range.
</p>
<p>
  <kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd> clicking on any of the clocks brings up a context menu
  allowing to change the type of time display between the <a href="@@editing-clocks">
  4 clock modes</a>, and to copy the selected clock's time to the clipboard.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
  The punch controls available in the main toolbar, work in conjunction with the
  punch clocks, only visible while in Editor Mode.
</p>

<p>
  The <kbd class="menu">In</kbd> and <kbd class="menu">Out</kbd> buttons relate
  to the Punch range, and allow to use only one of the two punch boundaries, or both:
</p>
<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>In only</th><td>Records from the In marker on, without an end boundary</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Out only</th><td>Records until the Out marker, without a beginning boundary</td></tr>
  <tr><th>In <em>and</em> Out</th><td>Records only between the In and Out markers</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  The punch clocks can be controlled the same way as the range clocks (moving the playhead,
  and changing the display mode).
</p>

<h2 id="rec-mode">Recording mode</h2>

<p>
  The recording mode affects how the tracks behave when overdubbing:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th>Layered</th>
  <td>
    New regions will be layered on top of existing ones. Only the top
    layer will be played. This is the recommended mode for most workflows.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Non-Layered</th>
  <td>
    The existing regions are trimmed so that there are no overlaps.
    This does not affect the previously recorded audio data, and trimmed
    regions can be expanded again at will. Non-layered mode can be very
    useful for spoken word material, especially in combination with
    <a href="@@pushpull-trimming">push/pull trimming</a>.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Snd on Snd</th>
  <td>
    New regions will be layered on top of existing ones and made
    transparent. This means all overlapping layers will be played
    at the same time. This mode is typically recommended for progressively
    building up MIDI tracks, e.g. a drum track, in each individual take.
  </td></tr>
</table>
