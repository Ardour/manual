<h2>Separate Under</h2>

<p>
  When one region is over another, and the lower region has to be cut so that it
  directly adjoins both ends of the overlapping one, with no overlaps, the <dfn>
  Separate Under</dfn> tool can be a very efficient time-saver.
  With the upper region selected, the <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Separate &gt; Separate
  Under</kbd> menu will split the lower region so that it no longer overlaps
  the upper region at all.
</p>

<p>
  If the upper region covers only one end of the lower region, then this
  operation is equivalent to <a href="@@trimming-regions">Trim to Next or Trim to Previous</a>,
  depending on which end is covered.
</p>

<h2>Separate Using Range</h2>
<p>
  A loop or punch range can also be used to slice a region. By using the
  <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Separate &gt; Separate Using Loop/Punch Range</kbd>,
  any selected regions that are covered by the range at both ends of the range,
  or just one if the range only covers part of the region. This makes it easy to
  generate regions that correspond precisely to a range.
