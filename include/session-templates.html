  <dfn>Session templates</dfn> are a way to store the setup of a session 
  for future use. They do not store any <em>audio</em> data but can store:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of tracks and busses, along with their names</li>
  <li>The plugins present on each track or bus (if any)</li>
  <li>All I/O connections</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating a Session Template</h2>
<p>
  Choose <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Save Template</kbd>. A dialog will ask 
  you for the name of the new template.
</p>
<h2>Using a Session Template</h2>
<p>
  In the New Session dialog, choose the desired template from the combo 
  selector.
</p>
<p>
  Note that you can also use an existing session as a template, without 
  saving it as one. This is available as an option in the New Session dialog. 
  Doing this will not alter the existing session at all, but will use its track, 
  bus and plugin configuration just like a template.
