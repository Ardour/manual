<p>
  Dynamic Processors&mdash;such as compressors&mdash;in general use the the original input signal for analysis and operate on
  the same signal. Side-chaining uses the signal level of <em>another input</em> to control the compression level of the
  original signal.
</p>

<p>
  Effect Processors which have a side-chain input (sometimes also called <em>key input</em>) have an additional input pin to
  receive a signal from an external input. In Ardour that extra input can be connected in the plugin's <kbd class="menu">Pin
  Configuration</kbd> dialog: the signal from one track can be tapped off and used as an input to a plugin on a different
  track. This dialog is accessed via the plugin's context-menu &gt; <kbd class="menu">Pin Connections&hellip;</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
  In case a plugin has a dedicated sidechain input, Ardour automatically creates a port for the input. This is a normal I/O
  port which can be fed by any external signal. The <kbd class="menu">Pin Configuration</kbd> dialog is not limited to
  processors with a dedicated sidechain input, it also allows to manually create (or remove) a sidechain input port and
  provides for flexible connection of the signal to plugin pins.
</p>

<p>
  The operational flow in the Ardour GUI starts at the processor which is to receive the signal: a sidechain source is
  selected, and Ardour creates a dedicated send-processor in the source processor box, the level of which can be adjusted
  either in the Pin Configuration window or directly on the source's send.
</p>

<h2>A simple example: Sidechain compression</h2>

<p>
  One example is the use of a bassdrum track to trigger the compression on a bass track. The sidechain compressor
  (a-Compressor) will be placed on the bass track, and will need to receive the signal from the bassdrum track as a way to
  trigger the compression.

<p>
  Here, on the bass track, an <em>a-Compressor</em> has been added, and the Drum track has been set as the sidechain source.
  The mixer reflects this by showing an <em>SC</em>-send processor in the drum track, very similar to a
  <a href="@@aux-sends">send</a>. The bass track also shows an arrow as one of the a-compressor input.
</p>

<p>
  As a result, in the editor, each peak in the kick drum track triggers the compression on the bass track and the resulting
  track shows the compression kicking in on each kick drum peak, hence reducing the gain. The compression is applied to the
  bass, but only based on the level of the drum track.
</p>

<p>
  This is commonly used for <em>ducking</em> effect, when e.g. a radio speaker's voice triggers the compression on the audio
  playing.
</p>

<h2>MIDI Sidechaining</h2>

<p>
  Ardour allows the sidechain sources to be either audio or MIDI tracks/busses. This is particularly useful when a MIDI signal
  is used to control an audio effect, like a vocoder or an auto-tuner, like <a href="https://github.com/x42/fat1.lv2">fat1</a>,
  the LV2 port of Fons Adriaensen's <a href="http://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/linuxaudio/zita-at1-doc/quickguide.html">Zita
  AT1</a> by Robin Gareus:

</figure>

<p>
  Here, the MIDI track is inputed to the plugin's MIDI IN pin through a sidechain, indicating to the plugin what note should
  the source audio be corrected to.
</p>

<p class="note">
  Notice that in the example above, the output of the "Vocals" track is connected to the input of the "Corrected" track. We
  could have chosen to insert the "Vocals" track content as an audio sidechain too, totally disconnecting the input from the
  plugin, and connecting the plugin's input pin to the audio sidechain port.
</p>

<h2>Pre-processing the sidechained signal</h2>

<p>
  Sometimes, the effects of a sidechain signal on a plugin can be enhanced by pre-processing the signal.
</p>

<p>
  In the first example above, if the entire drum part is on one track, then compressing with this signal as a sidechain will
  result in every peak triggering the compression, be they bass drum kicks or snare, cymbals, etc.
</p>

<p>
  In this case, adding an EQ to the drum track with a low pass filter would filter out the peaks created by the high pitched
  instruments of the drum kit, and allow for a better triggering, though to avoid damaging the original drum track, a send to
  an intermediary track would be better suited to place the EQ on. This track won't be connected to the Master, as its content
  is of no musical interest except for its use as a trigger, allowing for some extreme EQ.
