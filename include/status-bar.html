	The status bar is an informative bar at the top of the window. Right
	clicking anywhere on the Status Bar allows to choose which of this
	information is displayed, through a checkbox menu, among:</p>

<table class="dl">
	<tr><th>Path to Session:</th><td>the folder where the session files are</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Snapshot Name and Modified Indicator:</th><td>the name of the snapshot being worked on. If the session has been modified since last save, the name is prefixed with an asterisk (&ast;).</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Active Peak-file work:</th><td><em>(only shows up while creating peaks)</em> displays the number of peak files left to create</td></tr>
	<tr><th>File Format:</th><td>the file format used in the session, including when recording</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Timecode Format:</th><td>is the timecode, i.e. the number of frames per second used by the session (for videos)</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Audio:</th><td>gives the sample rate used in the session, and the latency computed from the buffer size</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Disk Space:</th><td>reports the remaining hard disk space as the time that can be recorded with the current session setting</td></tr>
	<tr><th>DSP:</th><td>for <em>D</em>igital <em>S</em>ound <em>P</em>rocessing, shows how much of the CPU is used by Ardour and its plugins</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Wall Clock</th><td>showing the system time (especially useful in full screen mode)</td></tr>
