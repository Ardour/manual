<p>
  <dfn>Stem exporting</dfn> allows to transfer files between different systems and
  softwares by exporting each track individually, including silence, to keep them
  in sync. All data will be lost except the actual audio/MIDI.
  This is one of the most common methods of interchange because it works between
  all DAWs.
</p>
<p>
	The Stem Export window, accessed via the <kbd class="menu">Session &gt;
  Export &gt; Stem Export&hellip;</kbd> menu, is very similar to the
  <a href="@@export-dialog">Export dialog</a>, except the 'Channels' tab appears
  slightly differently: in this case each chosen channel (track or bus) is exported
  to its own file, instead of all channels being mixed together into a single file.
</p>
<p>
  The exported tracks or busses can, by checking <kbd class="option">Apply
  track/bus processing</kbd>, be exported with the effects/processors applied,
  so that the destination system does not need those effects plugins.
