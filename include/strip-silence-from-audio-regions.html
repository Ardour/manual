  From the region context menu, choose <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Strip
  Silence</kbd> to detect silence (based on a user-chosen threshold in
  <abbr title="Decibels relative to Full Scale">dBFS</abbr>), split a

  to show silent segments and report the number and durations of the
  shortest segments.
