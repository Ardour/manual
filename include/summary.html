<p>
  The <dfn>Summary</dfn> is a global overview of the session, allowing for a good "bird's eye" view of where in time and tracks the work happens.
</p>

<p>
	Each horizontal line represents a track in the session, with the colored bars being the audio and MIDI regions, colored as per their track's color setting.
</p>

<p>
	Two yellow vertical lines show the position of the <em>Start</em> and <em>End</em> markers, defining the session's length. The red line shows the playhead's position.
</p>

<p>
	The transparent white rectangle represents what's actually displayed in the Editor window, i.e. what part of the session is being looked at on screen.
</p>

<p>The Summary also doubles as a navigator:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the arrow on the left allow to scroll the view horizontally to the left, by 1 length of the view each time</li>
	<li>the arrow on the right allow to scroll the view horizontally to the right, by 1 length of the view each time</li>
	<li>the white rectangle can be dragged anywhere on the session, moving the view accordingly</li>
	<li>the right and left borders of the white square can be resized, zooming in and out accordingly</li>
</ul>
