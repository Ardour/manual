<p>
  The <dfn>loop range</dfn> is a special range that defines the start and end points
  for loop play, which can be enabled in the transport bar.
</p>

<h2>Creating a Loop Range</h2>

<p>
  A loop range can be created in multiple ways.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    By <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd>-clicking on the Range Markers ruler at the
    top of the timeline, then selecting <kbd class="menu">Add &gt; Loop Range</kbd>.
  </li>
  <li>
    By selecting a region on the timeline,
    <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd>-clicking, then selecting
    <kbd class="menu">&lt;Region_Name&gt; &rarrow; Loop</kbd>. This will create
    a loop range's start and end markers matching the beginning and the end of
    the region, then start playback of the loop range immediately.
  </li>
	<li>
		By selecting a range on the timeline,
		<kbd class="mouse">right</kbd>-clicking, then selecting
		<kbd class="menu">Set Loop from Selection</kbd>. This will create a loop
		range's start and end markers matching the beginning and the end of the
		range selection respectively.
	</li>
	<li>
		By selecting a range on the timeline,
		<kbd class="mouse">right</kbd>-clicking, then selecting
		<kbd class="menu">Loop Range</kbd>. This will create the same loop
		region and start loop playback immediately.
	</li>
<!-- 	<li>
		By <kbd class="mod1 mouse">left</kbd>-dragging on the Loop/Punch Ranges
		ruler, releasing the mouse button, then choosing
		<kbd class="menu">Set Loop Range</kbd> in the pop-up menu.
	</li> -->
</ul>

<h2 id="more-options">More Options</h2>

<p>
  The right-click menu mostly copies that of a regular pair of range markers.
  The following options are available in addition to the ones mentioned above.
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr>
    <th>Play Range</th>
    <td>
      Starts playback at the left marker in the pair and stops at the right
      marker.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Locate to Marker</th>
    <td>
      Moves the playhead to the selected marker.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Play from Marker</th>
    <td>
      Moves the playhead to the selected marker and starts playback.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Loop Range</th>
    <td>
      Creates a loop range off the selected range markers pair and starts
      playback.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Set Marker from Playhead</th>
    <td>
      Changes the position of the selected marker to that of the playhead.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Zoom to Range</th>
    <td>
      Changes the zoom so that the area defined by the range markers would be
      maximized yet visible entirely within Ardour's window.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Loudness Assistant…</th>
    <td>
      Launches the Loudness Assistant to analyze the selection defined by the
      selected pair of range markers.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Export Range…</th>
    <td>
      Exports the selection defined by the selected pair of range markers.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Promote to Time Origin</th>
    <td>
      This makes the position of the chosen range marker the origin time. This
      is mostly useful when the <em>Display delta to origin marker</em> clock
      mode is enabled to display the difference between current playhead
      position and the origin time. Absolute time stays unaffected.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Separate Regions in Range</th>
    <td>
      Cuts all regions crossing the positions of the range markers.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Select All in Range</th>
    <td>
      Select entire regions that cross the borders of the range markers.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Select Range</th>
    <td>
      Create a selection from the range markers in all selected tracks and
      busses.
    </td>
  </tr>
