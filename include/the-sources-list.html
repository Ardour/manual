	The Sources list shows all the original audio and MIDI files in the session,
	either recorded in takes or imported from existing files. Any column caption
	can be clicked to sort the list according to the clicked value:
</p>

<table class="dl">
	<tr>
		<th>Name</th>
		<td>The name of the region, can be modified by double-clicking it.</td>
	<tr>
		<th># Ch</th>
		<td>
			The number of channels, only displayed for audio files (it is 0
			for MIDI files).
		</td>
	<tr>
		<th>Captured for</th>
		<td>The name of the track the source was originally captured in.</td>
	<tr>
		<th># Xruns</th>
		<td>How many dropouts occured while capturing the source.</td>
	<tr>
		<th>Tags</th>
		<td>
			All the <a href="@searching-for-files-using-tags">tags</a> assigned
			to the source.
		</td>
	<tr>
		<th>Take ID</th>
		<td>
			The unique ID of the source. Uses the timestamp for when the
			capturing of source was started. E.g. <tt>2023-10-16 14.08.58</tt>
			means the capturing started on October 16, 2023, at 2.08pm. This is
			only used for audio and MIDI sources that were captured, not
			imported.
		</td>
	<tr>
		<th>Orig Pos</th>
		<td>
			The original position at which the capturing of the source was
			started. The time format is whatever the user chose for the primary
			clock when the source was captured. Switching between time formats
			when capturing sources means the time format will not be the same
			for all captured sources.
		</td>
	<tr>
		<th>Path</th>
		<td>File name of the captured or imported source.</td>

	Hovering the mouse pointer over a column heading shows a tool-tip which can
	be handy to remember what the columns are for.
</p>

<p>
	<kbd class="mouse">right</kbd>-clicking on a source in the list brings up
	a context menu with just one item: <kbd class="menu">Remove the selected
	Sources</kbd>. Choosing it gives several options to the user:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Canceling the requested action and doing nothing.</li>
	<li>
		Removing just the regions that use the selected source, but not the
		sources themselves.
	</li>
	<li>
		Removing both the regions that use selected sources and deleting the
		selected sources. The latter action cannot be undone and requires using
		the <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Cleanup &gt; Flush Wastebasket</kbd>
		command to physically delete the sources.
	</li>
</ul>
