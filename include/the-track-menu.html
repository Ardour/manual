	The <kbd class="menu">Track</kbd> menu is where one can deal with the tracks, busses and control masters.
</p>

<table class="dl">
	<tr><th>Add Track, Bus or VCA&hellip;</th><td>Shows the <a href="@@adding-tracks-busses-and-vcas"><kbd class="menu">Add Track, Bus or VCA&hellip;</kbd> window</a>, where one can add one or more tracks, busses or control masters to the session and define its parameters</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Duplicate Tracks/Busses&hellip;</th><td>Shows the <kbd class="menu">Duplicate Tracks and Busses</kbd> window, allowing to duplicate the selected track(s) and optionally, its playlist</td></tr>

	<tr><th>Toggle Record Enable</th><td>Sets the Record Enable mode On on the selected track(s). These tracks will record audio/midi next time the global record is active and playback is started.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Toggle Solo</th><td>Sets the solo On on the selected tracks, so only these tracks will play</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Toggle Mute</th><td>Mutes the selected tracks, they won't play until unmuted</td></tr>

	<tr><th>Insert Time</th><td>Shows the <a href="@@insert-remove-time"><kbd class="menu">Insert Time</kbd> window</a>, allowing to insert a blank time in the selected tracks' playlist</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Remove Time</th><td>Same as <a href="@@insert-remove-time">above</a>, but to remove time</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Move Selected Tracks Up</th><td>Changes the position of the selected tracks one track up towards the top. In the mixer, the tracks will be moved to the left.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Move Selected Tracks Down</th><td>Same as above, towards the bottom</td></tr>
	<tr><th colspan="2">Height</th></tr>
		<tr><th class="sub1">Fit Selection (Vertical)</th><td>Will fit the selected track(s) in the window. If too many tracks are selected, they'll be reduced to their minimum height.</td></tr>
		<tr><th class="sub1">Largest</th><td>Sets the selected tracks height to a very high value, hence making the tracks wide on screen</td></tr>
		<tr><th class="sub1">Larger</th><td>Same as above, but a little less high</td></tr>
		<tr><th class="sub1">Large</th><td>Same as above, but again less high</td></tr>
		<tr><th class="sub1">Normal</th><td>Sets the height of the track to its default value which is a trade-off between readability and number of tracks displayed</td></tr>
		<tr><th class="sub1">Small</th><td>Reduces the size of the tracks to a low value, increasing the number of on screen tracks</td></tr>
	
	<tr><th>Toggle Layer Display</th><td>Toggles the selected track(s) visual <a href="@@layering-display">layering display</a> between <em>overlaid</em> and <em>stacked</em></td></tr>
	
	<tr><th>Toggle Active</th><td>Toggles the active state of a track. An inactive track will be grayed and won't play any sound. That can be seen in the <kbd class="menu">A</kbd> column of the <a href="@@the-tracks-and-busses-list">Tracks and Busses List</a></td></tr>
	<tr><th>Remove</th><td>Deletes this track and its playlist (no file is harmed in the process, and the regions from the playlist stay in the Editor for later use)</td></tr>
