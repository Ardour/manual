  This lists the tracks and busses that are present in the session. The list order
  reflects the order in the editor, and track or bus names can be dragged-and-dropped
  in the editor list to re-order them in the editor. The columns in the list
  represent the following:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr>
    <th id="visible">V</th>
    <td>
      Whether the track or bus is visible; they can be hidden, in which case they
      will still play, but just not be visible in the editor; this can be useful for
      keeping the display uncluttered.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th id="cue">C</th>
    <td>
      Whether the track is visiable on the Cue page, in which case it can be used
      for non-linear sequencing in the Cue window, but any content in the track
      visible in the Editor window will not be played.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th id="active">A</th>
    <td>
      Whether the track or bus is active; inactive tracks will not play, and
      will not consume any CPU.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th id="input">I</th>
    <td>
      For MIDI tracks, whether the MIDI input is enabled; this dictates whether
      MIDI data from the track's input ports will be passed through the track.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th id="record">R</th>
    <td>Whether the track is record-enabled.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <th id="record-safe">RS</th>
    <td>
      Whether the track is record safe; a record safe track cannot be armed for
      recording, to protect against a mistake.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th id="mute">M</th>
    <td>Whether the track is muted.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th id="solo">S</th>
    <td>Track solo state.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th id="solo-isolated">SI</th>
    <td>Track solo-isolated state.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <th id="solo-safe">SS</th>
    <td>Solo safe state. </td></tr>
</table>

<p class="note">
  Each icon in these columns can be clicked to toggle the track/bus state, which
  is a very fast way to set multiple tracks/busses state at once.
</p>

<p>
  As with the region list, hovering the mouse pointer over a column heading shows
  a tool-tip which can be handy to remember what the columns are for.
