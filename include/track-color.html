<p>
  New tracks in Ardour are assigned a random color from a pastel color
  palette, so they should never end up being particularly bright or 
  particularly dark. 
</p>

<h2>Changing the color of specific tracks</h2>

<p>
  Select the tracks whose color you wish to change. Context-click
  on the track header of one of them. From the context menu, select 
  <kbd class="menu">Color</kbd> and pick a hue to your taste in the
  color dialog. Every selected track will be 
  re-colored.
</p>

<p>
  Note that if you are only changing one track, context-clicking on 
  that track's header will be enough to select it, saving the extra 
  mouse click.
</p>

<h2>Changing the color of all tracks in a group</h2>

<p>
  Tracks that belong to a 
  <a href="@@the-track-and-bus-group-list">track/bus group</a> 
  can share a common color by enabling the <kbd
  class="option">Color</kbd> option for the group. With this enabled,
  any color change will be propagated to all group members.
</p>

<p>
  You can also explicitly change the group color by context-clicking 
  on the group tab in the Mixer, selecting <kbd class="menu">Edit
  Group&hellip;</kbd> and then clicking on the Color selector in that dialog
  that is displayed. 
</p>
