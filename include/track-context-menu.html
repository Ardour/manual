<p>
  Within the editor window, context-clicking (<kbd class="mouse">right</kbd>
click) on either a region or empty space within a track displays the <dfn>track
context menu</dfn>. The context menu provides easy access to many track-level
operations.
</p>
<p>
  If a <dfn>region</dfn> is clicked, the first item in the menu is the name of
  the region. If a <a href="@@layering-display">layered region</a> is clicked,
  the next item in the menu is <kbd class="menu">Choose Top</kbd>. If selected,
  a dialog appears that allows to change the vertical order of layers at that
  point. See <a href="@@layering-display">Layering Display</a> for more details.
</p>
<p>
  The rest of the track context menu is structured as follows:
