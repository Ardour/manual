<p>
  At some stage of the production, a quick overview over as many tracks as
  possible may be required, or a detailed view into just a
  few, or a combination of the two. To facilitate this, the
  <dfn>height</dfn> can be configured individually for each track in
  the editor window, or globally.
</p>

<h2>Resizing one or a few tracks</h2>

<p>
  A <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd> click on a track header will display the
  <kbd class="menu">Height</kbd> menu, and allow to choose from a list of
  standard sizes. All selected tracks will be redrawn using that height.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, moving the pointer to the bottom edge of a track header will change
  the cursor to a two-way vertical arrow shape. <kbd
  class="mouse">Left</kbd>-dragging  dynamically resizes all selected tracks.
</p>

<h2>Resizing all the tracks</h2>

<p>
  The three rightmost items of the <a href="@@zoom-controls">Zoom Controls</a>,
  in the toolbar, allow to quickly resize multiple tracks' heights at once, or to
  display a selected number of tracks in the editor, or all the selected ones, etc.
</p>

<h2>Fitting to the Editor Window</h2>

<p>
  Fitting one or many tracks to the Editor window can be done by selecting the tracks to
  display and choosing <kbd class="menu">Track &gt; Height &gt; Fit Selection (Vertical)</kbd>
  or using the keyboard shortcut, <kbd>f</kbd>. Ardour adjusts the track
  heights and view so that the selected tracks completely fill the vertical
  space available, unless the tracks cannot be fitted even at the smallest
  possible size.
</p>
<p class="note">
  The <dfn>Visual Undo</dfn> (default shortcut: <kbd class="mod3">Z</kbd>) can be
  used to revert this operation.
