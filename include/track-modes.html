<p>
  Audio tracks in Ardour have a <dfn>mode</dfn> which affects how they behave
  when recording:
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr>
    <th>Layered</th>
    <td>
      Tracks in <dfn>layered mode</dfn> will record
      non-destructively&nbsp;&mdash; new data is written to new files, and when
      overdubbing, new regions will be layered on top of existing ones. This is
      the recommended mode for most workflows. When recording with the
      <dfn>layered mode</dfn>, Ardour only does input monitoring.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Non-Layered</th>
    <td>
      Tracks using <dfn>non-layered mode</dfn> will record
      non-destructively&mdash;new data is written to new files, but when
      overdubbing, the existing regions are trimmed so that there are no
      overlaps. This does not affect the previously recorded audio data, and
      trimmed regions can be expanded again at will. Non-layered mode can be
      very useful for spoken word material, especially in combination with
      <a href="@@pushpull-trimming">push/pull trimming</a>. When recording with
      the <dfn>non-layered mode</dfn>, Ardour only does input monitoring.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Sound on Sound</th>
    <td>
      Tracks using <dfn>Sound on Sound mode</dfn> will record
      non-destructively&nbsp;&mdash; new data is written to new files, but when
      overdubbing, new regions will be layered on top of existing ones in
      non-opaque mode which means both existing and new material will be played
      back after the recording is over. This is convenient for a variety of use
      cases, such as adding MIDI Control Change events on top of recorded live
      performance. When recording in the <dfn>sound-on-sound mode</dfn>, Ardour
      does cue monitoring.
    </td>
  </tr>

<p>
  Results of recording in layered and non-layered modes are visually the same.
  However, with the sound-on-sound mode lower layers are visible under upper
  layers, because in that case new regions with overdubs are created with
  disabled <em>Opaque</em> setting.

  To illustrate the difference, here is the screenshot of the same tracks, but
  this time&nbsp;&mdash; in <em>Stacked</em> track mode (rather than
  <em>Overlaid</em> as on the screenshot above).

<p>
  The overdub is an opaque region on top of the original content for the
  <em>Layered</em> mode. For the <em>Non-Layered</em> mode, it completely
  replaces the matching part of the original content. And for the
  <em>Sound on Sound</em> mode, it's a transparent region on top of the original
  content.
</p>

<p>
  The switch between layered, non-layered, and sound-on-sound modes is a global
  setting available in the main toolbar right below the buttons enabling
  Punch In and Punch Out.
