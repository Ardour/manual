<p>
	Track templates simplify recording of new material by reusing tried and true
	I/O and processing settings. They are listed in the <kbd class="menu">Add
	Track/Bus/VCA</kbd> dialog below regular options such as audio and tracks,
	busses, and VCAs.
</p>

<p>
	Each track templates stores the entire state of a track it was created from:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>I/O configuration including sends and inserts</li>
	<li>State of mixer controls (mute, solo, solo iso/lock etc.)</li>
	<li>All the processors and their settings</li>
</ul>

<p>
	To create a new track template, <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd>-click the
	name of the track in its mixer channel and select
	<kbd class="menu">Save Track Templateâ€¦</kbd>
</p>

<p>
	In the newly opened dialog, add a description for the template, then
	give it a name that will be displayed in the <kbd class="menu">Add
	Track/Bus/VCA</kbd> dialog, click <kbd>Save</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
	A slightly verbose description of a template will be helpful when there are
	multiple similar templates available.

<p>
	Track templates are managed in the same dialog as session templates.
</p>

<p>
	You can rename existing templates to help differentiate between similar
	options, change the description, or remove an existing template.
</p>

<p>
	Additionally, you can export all track templates to an archive for sharing,
	or import track templates from an archive that someone shared with you.
