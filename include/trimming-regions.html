<p>
  Changing the <dfn>length</dfn> of a region is a very common editing
  operation, often known as <dfn>trimming</dfn>. There are several ways
  to accomplish this with Ardour, and some very useful specialized trimming
  operations.
</p>

<h2>Drag-Trimming With the Mouse</h2>

  <img src="/images/trimming-region-after.png" alt="Trimming region - after">
  <figcaption>
    Trimming region - before and after
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  In Grab mode, moving the pointer near the beginning or end of the region changes
  the cursor to indicate that trimming is possible, and the edge of the region can
  then be <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd>-dragged in both directions.
</p>
<p>
  Trimming will obey <a href="@@grid-controls">Snap settings</a>.
</p>

<h2>Other Trimming operations</h2>
<p>
  There are several commands for region trimming. Some use the
  <a href="@@edit-point-control">edit point</a> to determine where
  to trim to. Some are not bound to any keys by default (but could be via the
  <a href="@@default-keyboard-bindings">Keybindings Editor</a>).
</p>
<p>
  These command are both in the <kbd class="menu">Region &gt; Trim</kbd> main menu
  (with a region selected) or in the contect menu of a region, <kbd class="menu">
  <kbd class="mouse">right</kbd> click on a region &gt; <em>Name_Of_The_Region</em>
  &gt; Trim</kbd>
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th><dfn>Trim Start at Edit Point</dfn> (<kbd>j</kbd>)</th>
  <td>Trim selected region(s) start to edit point.</td></tr>
  <tr><th><dfn>Trim End at Edit Point</dfn> (<kbd>k</kbd>)</th>
  <td>Trim selected region(s) end to edit point.</td></tr>
  <tr><th><dfn>Trim to Loop/Punch</dfn></th>
  <td>Trim selected region(s) beginning and end to the loop/punch boundaries (if it exists).</td></tr>
  <tr><th><dfn>Trim to Previous</dfn> (<kbd class="mod1">j</kbd>)</th>
  <td>Trim the start of selected region(s) to the end of the previous region.
    If the region is too short, it is extended to its maximum to the left.</td></tr>
  <tr><th><dfn>Trim to Next</dfn> (<kbd class="mod1">k</kbd>)</th>
  <td>Trim the end of selected region(s) to the start of the following region.
    If the region is too short, it is extended to its maximum to the right.</td></tr>
