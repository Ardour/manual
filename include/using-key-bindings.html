  Ardour has many available commands for playback control that can be bound
  to keys. Many of them have <a href="@@keyboard-shortcuts">default
  bindings</a>, Some of the most used are found below.
</p>

<p>
  Those keybindings are shown in the corresponding menus. Memorizing at least
  the most frequently used can be a great time saver.
</p>

<table class="dl">
  <tr><th><kbd>Space</kbd></th>
  <td>switch between playback and stop.</td></tr>
  <tr><th><kbd>Home</kbd></th>
  <td>Move playhead to session start marker</td></tr>
  <tr><th><kbd>End</kbd></th>
  <td>Move playhead to session end marker</td></tr>
  <tr><th><kbd>&rarr;</kbd></th>
  <td>Playhead to Next Grid</td></tr>
  <tr><th><kbd>&larr;</kbd></th>
  <td>Playhead to Previous Grid</td></tr>
  <tr><th><kbd>0</kbd></th>
  <td>Move playhead to start of the timeline</td></tr>
  <tr><th><kbd class="mod3">space</kbd></th>
  <td>Start recording</td></tr>
  <tr><th><kbd class="mod1">space</kbd></th>
