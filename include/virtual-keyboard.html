<p>
  The <dfn>Virtual Keyboard</dfn> is a software MIDI instrument, similar to
  <a href="https://vmpk.sourceforge.io/">VMPK</a> that can be used like an
  hardware musical keyboard would, to emit MIDI events.
</p>

<p>
  It can be used to test or record MIDI notes or events, as the computer 
  keyboard can be (and is, by default) mapped to the virtual MIDI keyboard.
  The keyboard layout can be chosen in the 
  <a href="@@preferences#preferences-midi">MIDI Preferences</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The lower part of the window is a piano keyboard. The current keyboard
  mapping is overlaid on the notes, as are the different <em>C</em> notes,
  indicating what octaves are shown.
</p>

<p>
  The upper part comprises (from left to right):
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		A channel selector to choose on which MIDI channel the events are generated
	</li>
	<li>
		A pitch bend that can bend &plusmn;2 semtones up or down. The controls are:
		<ul>
			<li>Mousewheel up/down : persistent bend up/down</li>
			<li>Mouse-drag up/down (by <kbd class="mouse">left</kbd>-clicking
			anywhere in the slider) : sprung-mode bend up/down (returns to
			&plus;0 semitone when the mouse button is released)</li>
			<li><kbd>F1</kbd> : abruptly &minus;2 semitones</li>
			<li><kbd>F2</kbd> : abruptly &minus;1 semitone</li>
			<li><kbd>F3</kbd> : abruptly &plus;1 semitone</li>
			<li><kbd>F4</kbd> : abruptly &plus;2 semitones</li>
			<li><kbd>&darr;</kbd> : ramps to &minus;2 semitones</li>
			<li><kbd>&uarr;</kbd> : ramps to &plus;2 semitones.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		A modulator, with a modulation depth between 0 and 127, 127 being
		a modulation of &plusmn; 1 semitone, so 2 semtones peak-to-peak.
	</li>
	<li>
		Four assignable knobs. By default, they are:
		<ul>
			<li>CC-7 (Channel Volume)</li>
			<li>CC-8 (Balance)</li>
			<li>CC-91 (Reverb)</li>
			<li>CC-7 (Chorus)</li>
		</ul>
		These controls can be assigned as needed by clicking the button under
		each knob and selecting a different Control Number.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Octave</em> : a selector to choose where on the keyboard (on which
		octave) the keyboard view is. The chosen octave will be the second one
		displayed, i.e. if "Octave" is set to 3, the leftmost displayed octave
		will be 2.<br>
		The selected octave is also where the keyboard mapping is set, so
		if the octave is set to 3, in a QWERTY setup, the leftmost (lowest) note,
		<kbd>Z</kbd>, is mapped to C3.<br>
		The controls are:
		<ul>
			<li><kbd>&larr;</kbd> : decrease Octave by one (i.e., scroll the view to the left)</li>
			<li><kbd>&rarr;</kbd> : increase Octave by one (i.e., scroll the view to the right)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Range</em> determines how many octaves are displayed.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Velocity</em> sets the intensity of the note, which contributes 
		to its audio volume, and can, depending on the virtual instrument,
		play a role in the sample selection.<br>
		Although the drop down menu only lists a few values, scrolling the mouse
		over the control, as with the other selectors, allows to change its
		value with a finer in/decrement.
	</li>
	<li>
		A <em>Transpose</em> selector, that shifts the notes played by its value
		in semitones, either up or down, effectively tuning the whole keyboard.
	</li>
	<li>
		A <em>Panic</em> button, to immediately stop all MIDI sound.
	</li>

</ul>
