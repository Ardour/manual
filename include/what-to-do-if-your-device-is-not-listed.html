  All Mackie Control devices are based on the original Logic Control and the
  documentation in the user manual that came with it. The Mackie Control and
  the Mackie Control Pro and so on, all use this same protocol. Any units
  from other manufactures will also use the same encoding as best the
  hardware will allow. If the unit in use has more than one Mackie Control
  option, it is best to choose Logic Control or LC. Any Templates for the
  buttons should be chosen the same way as the Function key Editor uses these
  button names. The "Mackie Control" option should be considered default and
  should be tried with any unlisted device before attempting to create a
  custom definition file.
