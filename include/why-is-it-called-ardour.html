  The name <dfn>"Ardour"</dfn> came from considerations of how to pronounce the
  acronym <abbr title="Hard Disk Recorder">HDR</abbr>. The most obvious attempt
  sounds like a vowel-less "harder" and it was then a short step to an
  unrelated but slightly homophonic word:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
  <dfn>ardour</dfn> <em>n</em> 1: a feeling of strong eagerness (usually in
  favor of a person or cause); "they were imbued with a revolutionary ardor";
  "he felt a kind of religious zeal" [syn: ardor, elan, zeal]<br>
  2: intense feeling of love [syn: ardor]<br>
  3: feelings of great warmth and intensity; "he spoke with great ardor" [syn:
  ardor, fervor, fervour, fervency, fire, fervidness]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
  Given the work required to develop Ardour, and the personality of its primary
  author, the name seemed appropriate even without the vague relationship to
  HDR.

  Years later, another interpretation of "Ardour" appeared, this time based on
  listening to non-native English speakers attempt to pronounce the word.
  Rather than "Ardour", it became "Our DAW", which seemed poetically fitting
  for a Digital Audio Workstation whose source code and design belongs to a
  group of collaborators.
