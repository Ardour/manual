There are already a number of excellent digital audio workstations. To
mention just a few: ProTools, Nuendo, Samplitude, Digital Performer, Logic, 
Cubase (SX), Sonar, along with several less well known systems such as 
SADIE, SAWStudio and others.<br />
Each of these programs has its strengths and weaknesses, although over the
last few years most of them have converged on a very similar set of core
features. However, each of them suffers from two problems when seen from the
perspective of Ardour's development group:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>they do not run natively on Linux</li>
  <li>they are not available in source code form, making modifications, 
  improvements, bugfixes by technically inclined users or their friends
  or consultants impossible.</li>
</ul>
