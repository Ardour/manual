<p>
  Ardour supports multiple types of markers, all designed for particular tasks:
  single markers that define a location, single markers that change a value,
  paired markers that define a range on a timeline etc.
</p>

<h2 id="creating-new-markers">Creating New Markers</h2>

<p>
  There are several ways to create markers in Ardour.
</p>

<p>
  The most common way is to right-click over a ruler and select a menu item
  called like <kbd class="menu">Add &gt; Loop Range</kbd> (for the
  <kbd class="title">Range Markers</kbd> ruler) or
  <kbd class="menu">Add New Tempo</kbd> (for the
  <kbd class="title">Tempo</kbd> ruler).
</p>

</figure>

<p>
  Some of the markers can be created from context menus on the canvas.
  E.g. range markers can be created by creating a range, opening the context
  (right-click) menu and choosing <kbd class="menu">Add Range Markers</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, location markers and range markers can be created from the
  <kbd class="title">Ranges&nbsp;&amp; Marks</kbd> sidebar by clicking
  <kbd class="title">Ranges&nbsp;&amp; Marks</kbd> or
  <kbd class="title">Ranges&nbsp;&amp; Marks</kbd> respectively.
</p>

<h2 id="moving-markers">Moving Markers</h2>

<p>
  Once a single or a paired marker has been added, it can be moved around.
</p>

<h3 id="moving-single-marker">Single marker</h3>
<p>
  <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd>-clicking and dragging moves a single marker to a
  new location on the timeline.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, markers can be moved to playhead position by right-clicking and
  choosing the <kbd class="menu">Move Mark to Playhead</kbd> menu item.
</p>

<h3 id="moving-multiple-marker">Multiple markers</h3>
<p>
  It is possible to move multiple markers by the same distance. <kbd
  class="mouse mod1">Left</kbd>-clicking each discrete marker, or <kbd
  class="mouse mod3">Left</kbd>-clicking the first and last markers of a range
  of markers selects them, then dragging one to a new location will move all
  selected markers together.
</p>
<p class="note">
  The markers are bounded by the zero point on the timeline. In other words, the
  first marker in the selection cannot move to the left of zero on the timeline.
</p>

<h3 id="moving-entire-range-marker">Both ends of a range marker</h3>
<p>
  By <kbd class="mod1 mouse">left</kbd>-dragging either end of the range marker,
  the other end will move by the same distance.
</p>

<h2 id="renaming-markers">Renaming Markers</h2>

<p>
  Some markers on the ruler can have unique names: location markers, CD markers,
  range markers. Double-clicking on them opens a dialog where a different name
  can be submitted.
</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Alternatively, right-clicking on a marker will open a context menu with a menu
  item called <kbd class="title">Rename...</kbd> or
  <kbd class="title">Rename Range...</kbd>, depending on the type of the marker.
  The same dialog for submitting a new name will appear.
</p>

<h2 id="editing-marker-properties">Editing Marker's Properties</h2>

<p>
  Markers on rulers such as <kbd class="title">Time Signature</kbd> or
  <kbd class="title">Tempo</kbd> don't have unique names, however they do have
  other properties that can be edited. The principle is the same as with
  renaming: double-clicking on a marker or right-clicking and choosing the
  <kbd class="title">Edit...</kbd> menu item.
</p>

<h2 id="hiding-markers">Hiding Markers</h2>

<p>
  Most marker types can be temporarily hidden from the ruler if the user chooses
  to do so. The user interface for that is available in the
  <kbd class="title">Ranges&nbsp;&amp; Marks</kbd> sidebar: it is a simple
  <kbd class="title">Hide</kbd> checkbox for each marker.
</p>

<figure>
    <img class="hdimage" src="/images/regions-and-marks.png" alt="Hiding Markers">
    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Clicking the respective <kbd class="title">Hide</kbd> checkbox again will
  reveal the marker on the ruler again.
</p>

<h2 id="removing-markers">Removing Markers</h2>

<p>
  There are three ways to permanently delete a marker. The first one is to
  right-click the marker of choice, then select
  <kbd class="menu">Remove</kbd> in the menu.
</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  The second one is to click a marker to select it, keep hovering the mouse
  pointer, then press <kbd class="key">Del</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
  The third way is to click the markers' <kbd class="button">x</kbd> button in
  the <em>Ranges&nbsp;&amp; Marks</em> sidebar.
</p>

<h2 id="additional actions">Additional Actions</h2>

<p>
  Depending on the type of a marker additional actions are possible, such as
  moving the playhead to a location marker's position or zooming to a range
  saved with range markers. This is covered in dedicated subchapters for
  respective ruler/marker types.
