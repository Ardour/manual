<p>The zoom controls allow to navigate the session along both the time and track axes.</p>

<p>The drop down <kbd class="menu">Zoom Focus</kbd> menu allows to select a focus point for the zoom, i.e. the center of the zoom. The choices are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><dfn>Left</dfn> of the screen</li>
  <li><dfn>Right</dfn> of the screen</li>
  <li><dfn>Center</dfn> of the screen</li>
  <li><dfn>Playhead</dfn></li>
  <li><dfn>Mouse</dfn></li>
  <li><dfn>Edit Point</dfn> as set in the <a href="@@edit-point-control">Edit point</a> control.</li>
</ul>

<p>The two leftmost zoom buttons (<kbd class="menu">&minus;</kbd> and <kbd class="menu">&plus;</kbd>) use this zoom focus to zoom out and in respectively.<p>

<p>The <kbd class="menu">Zoom to session</kbd> button is a handy shortcut to zoom out or in until all the session (as defined by its <a href="@@working-with-markers">start/end markers</a>) fits horizontally.</p>

<p>Changing the <kbd class="menu">Number of visible tracks</kbd> dropdown menu
allows to fit this number of tracks vertically in the screen.<p>

<p class="note">There <em>is</em> a minimal track height to keep it visible, so
according to you screen vertical size, some high number can have no effect.</p>

<p>Inside this menu are two handy choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li><dfn>Selected tracks</dfn> that focus on the selected tracks. If the selected tracks are not contiguous, the unselected tracks inbetween will be hidden, see the <a href="@@the-tracks-and-busses-list">Track and Bus list</a>.</li>
  <li><dfn>All</dfn> that fits all the tracks of the sessions vertically (provided there's enough screen estate).</li>
</ul>

<p>The rightmost buttons <kbd class="menu">Shrink tracks</kbd> and <kbd class="menu">Expand tracks</kbd> reduce or expand the vertical size of the selected tracks. If no track is selected, all the tracks will be shrunk or expanded each time the button is pushed.
