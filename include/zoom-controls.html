	The zoom controls allow to navigate the session along both the time 
	and track axes. The controls are dscribed from right to left :
</p>

<h2 id="zoom-along-time-axis">Along the time axis</h2>

<p>
	The drop down <em>Zoom Focus</em> (<kbd class="menu">Playhead</kbd> 
	by default) menu allows to select a focus point for the zoom, i.e. 
	the center of the zoom, to choose amongst:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><dfn>Left</dfn> of the screen</li>
  <li><dfn>Right</dfn> of the screen</li>
  <li><dfn>Center</dfn> of the screen</li>
  <li><dfn>Playhead</dfn></li>
  <li><dfn>Mouse</dfn></li>
  <li><dfn>Edit Point</dfn> as set in the <a href="@@edit-point-control">Edit point</a> control.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The two zoom buttons (<kbd class="menu">&minus;</kbd> and <kbd 
	class="menu">&plus;</kbd>) use this zoom focus to zoom out and in 
	respectively.
<p>

<p>
	The <kbd class="menu">[&nbsp;]</kbd> <em>Zoom to session</em> 
	button is a handy shortcut to zoom out or in until all the session 
	(as defined by its <a href="@@working-with-markers">start/end 
	markers</a>) fits horizontally.
</p>

<h2 id="zoom-along-track-axis">Along the tracks axis</h2>

<p>
	Two buttons <kbd class="menu">Shrink tracks</kbd> and 
	<kbd class="menu">Expand tracks</kbd> reduce or expand the vertical 
	size of the selected tracks. If no track is selected, all the 
	tracks will be shrunk or expanded each time the button is pushed.
</p>

<p>
	Last, the dropdown menu (<kbd class="menu">*</kbd> by default) 
	allows changing the number of visible tracks to fit vertically on 
	screen.
<p>

<p class="note">
	There <em>is</em> a minimal track height to keep it visible, so 
	according to the vertical screen size, some high number can have no 
	effect.
</p>

<p>
	Besides numbers that correspond to the number of tracks to show, 
	there are two special choices:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
	<dfn>Selection</dfn> that focus on the selected tracks. If 
	  the selected tracks are not contiguous, the unselected tracks 
	  inbetween will be hidden, see the <a 
	  href="@@the-tracks-and-busses-list">Track and Bus list</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
	  <dfn>All</dfn> that fits all the tracks of the sessions 
	  vertically (provided there's enough screen estate).
  </li>
</ul>
