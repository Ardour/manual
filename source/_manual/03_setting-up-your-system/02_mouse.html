<p>
  Ardour is designed to work best with a <dfn>three button mouse</dfn> 
  equipped with a <dfn>scroll wheel</dfn>.
</p>
<p>
  It can be used with a two button mouse or touchpad, but at least two key
  operations will not (easily) be available to you:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>time-constrained region copying</li>
  <li><a href="/using-control-surfaces/midi-learn/"><abbr title="Musical
  Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</abbr> bindings</a>
  created by "learning" them from incoming MIDI data</li>
</ul>
<p>
  You are strongly encouraged to invest in a three-button mouse. You will
  find that a good quality mouse (especially one with a weighted,
  latchable scroll wheel) will make your use of Ardour vastly more
  efficient. They are cheap, and time is not.
