  In order for CoreMIDI to work with Jack MIDI, a CoreMIDI-to-JACK-MIDI
  <dfn>bridge</dfn>
  is required. This feature is available on versions equal to or great than
  version 0.89 of JackOSX.

<h2>Routing MIDI</h2>
<h3>Inside Ardour</h3>

  MIDI ports show up in Ardour's MIDI connection matrix in multiple
  locations. Bridged CoreMIDI ports as well as JACK MIDI ports that have 
  been created by other software clients will show up under the "Other" tab. 
  Bridged CoreMIDI hardware ports show up under the "Hardware" tab.
