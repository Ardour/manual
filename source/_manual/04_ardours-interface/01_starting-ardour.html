title: Starting Ardour
---                        
  
<p>
  There are several ways of <dfn>starting Ardour</dfn>, which may vary
  depending on which platform you are using it.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>double-click the Ardour icon in your platform's file manager (e.g. 
  Nautilus on Linux, Finder on OS X)</li>
  <li>double click on an Ardour session file in your platform's file manager</li>
  <li>on Linux, you can also start Ardour <a 
  href="/ardours-interface/starting-ardour/starting-ardour-from-the-command-line">on 
  the command line</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  When Ardour is run for the very first time, a special dialog is displayed 
  that will ask you several questions about your setup. You will not be asked
  these questions again, but you can always modify your choices via the
  <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences</kbd> dialog.
</p>
<p>
  In general, it is sensible to start JACK before you run Ardour. This is not
  necessary, but will provide you with more control and options over JACK's
  operation.
</p>
<p>
  If you open Ardour without specifying an existing session it will display 
  the <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; New...</kbd> dialog. If JACK is not already
  running, there will be an extra <kbd class="menu">Audio Engine</kbd> tab in
  that dialog to configure JACK, which Ardour will then start automatically.
</p>
<p>
  If you did specify an existing session but JACK is not already running, the
  <kbd class="menu">New Session</kbd> dialog will contain just the Audio Engine tab.
