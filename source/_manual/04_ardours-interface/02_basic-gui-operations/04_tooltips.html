<p>
  By default, Ardour will show helpful <dfn>tooltips</dfn> about
  the purpose and use of each <abbr title="Graphical User
  Interface">GUI</abbr> element if you position the pointer 
  over it and hover there for a short while. 
  These little pop-up messages can be a good way to discover the
  purpose of many aspects of the GUI.
</p>
<p>
  Pop-ups can be distracting for experienced users, who may opt to
  disable them via <kbd class="optoff">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; GUI &gt; 
  Show tooltip if mouse hovers over a control</kbd>.
