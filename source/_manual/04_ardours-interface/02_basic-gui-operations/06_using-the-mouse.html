<h2>Clicking</h2>
<p>
  Throughout this manual, the term <dfn>click</dfn> refers to the act of pressing
  and releasing the <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd> mouse button. This action is used to select objects, activate
  buttons, turn choices on and off, pop up menus and so forth.<br />
  On touch surfaces, it also corresponds to a single, one-finger tap on 
  the GUI.
</p>

<h2>Right Clicking</h2>
<p>
  The term <dfn>right-click</dfn> refers to the act of pressing and releasing 
  the <kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd> mouse button. 
  This action is used to pop up <dfn>context menus</dfn> (hence the term 
  "context click", which you will also see). It is also used by default in
  combination with the shift key to delete objects within the editor
  window.
</p>
<p class="note mac"> 
  Some mice designed for use with Mac OS X may have only one button. By
  convention, pressing and holding the Control key while clicking is
  interpreted as a right-click by many application..
</p>

<h2>Middle Clicking</h2>
<p>
  A <dfn>middle-click</dfn> refers to the act of pressing and releasing the
  <kbd class="mouse">Middle</kbd> mouse button. Not all all mice have a middle click button 
  (see the <a href="/setting-up-your-system/mouse/">Mouse</a> chapter for
  details). Sometimes the scroll wheel acts as a clickable middle button. 
  This action is used for time-constrained region copying and mapping MIDI
  bindings.
</p>
<p class="note">
  Internally, your operating system may identify the mouse buttons as 
  <kbd class="mouse">Button1</kbd>, <kbd class="mouse">Button2</kbd>, and
  <kbd class="mouse">Button3</kbd>, respectively. It may be possible to 
  invert the order of buttons to accommodate left-handed users, or to re-assign
  them arbitrarily. This manual assumes the canonical order.
</p>

<h2>Double Clicking</h2>
<p>
  A <dfn>double click</dfn> refers to two rapid press/release cycles on the
  leftmost mouse button. The time interval between the two actions that
  determines whether this is seen as two clicks or one double click is
  controlled by your system preferences, not by Ardour.
</p>

<h2>Dragging</h2>
<p>
  A <dfn>drag</dfn> primarily refers to the act of pressing the leftmost
  mouse button, moving the mouse with the button held down, and then 
  releasing the button. On touch surfaces, this term also corresponds to 
  a single one-finger touch-move-release action.
</p>
<p>
  Ardour also uses the middle mouse button for certain kinds of drags,
  which will be referred to as <dfn>middle-drag</dfn>.
</p>

<h2>Modifiers</h2>
<p>
  There are many actions in Ardour that can be carried out using a mouse
  button in combination with a <dfn>modifier key</dfn>. When the manual 
  refers to <kbd class="mod1 mouse">Left</kbd>, it means that you should first 
  press the <kbd class="mod1"></kbd> key, carry out a left click
  while <kbd class="mod1"></kbd> is held down, and then finally release the key.
</p>
<p>
  Available modifiers depend on your platform:
</p>
<h3>Linux Modifiers</h3>
<ul>
  <li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (Control)</li>
  <li><kbd>Shift</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>Alt</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>Mod2</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>Mod3</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>Mod4</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>Mod5</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p class="warning">
  The following section is almost certainly wrong. Will need to be checked
  and rewritten asap.
</p>
<p>
  Mod2 typically corresponds to the <kbd>NumLock</kbd> key on many systems.
  On most Linux systems, there are no keys that will function as modifiers
  Mod3, Mod4 or Mod5 by default, but they can be setup using
  <dfn>xmodmap(1)</dfn>. This can be rather useful.
</p>

<h3>OS X Modifiers</h3>
<ul>
  <li><kbd>Cmd</kbd> (Command, "windmill")</li>
  <li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (Control)</li>
  <li><kbd>Alt</kbd>  (Option)</li>
  <li><kbd>Shift</kbd></li>
</ul>

<h2>Scroll Wheel</h2>
<p>
  Ardour can make good use of a <dfn>scroll wheel</dfn> on your mouse, which can be
  utilized for a variety of purposes. Scroll wheels generate vertical 
  scroll events, <kbd class="mouse">&uArr;</kbd> (ScrollUp) and 
  <kbd class="mouse">&dArr;</kbd> (ScrollDown). Some also emit horizontal 
  events, <kbd class="mouse">&lArr;</kbd> (ScrollLeft) and 
  <kbd class="mouse">&rArr;</kbd> (ScrollRight).
</p>
<p>
  When appropriate, Ardour will differentiate between these two different
  scroll axes. Otherwise it will interpret ScrollDown and ScrollLeft as
  equivalent and similarly interpret ScrollUp and ScrollRight as equivalent.
</p>
<p>
  Typically, scroll wheel input is used to adjust
  <dfn>continuous controls</dfn> such as faders and knobs, or to scroll
  vertically or horizontally inside a window.
