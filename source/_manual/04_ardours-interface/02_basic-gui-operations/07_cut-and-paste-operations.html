<p>
  The <dfn>clipboard</dfn> is a holder for various kinds of objects (regions,
  control events, plugins) that is used during <dfn>cut-and-paste
  operations</dfn>.
</p>

<h2>Cut</h2>
<p>
  A <dfn>cut</dfn> operation removes selected objects and places them in the
  clipboard. The existing contents of the clipboard are overwriten.<br />
  The default key binding is <kbd class="mod1">x</kbd>.
</p>

<h2>Copy</h2>
<p>
  A <dfn>copy</dfn> of the selected objects are placed in clipboard. There is
  no effect on the selected objects themselves. The existing contents of the
  clipboard are overwritten. <br />
  The default key binding is <kbd class="mod1">c</kbd>.
</p>

<h2>Paste</h2>
<p>
  The current contents of the clipboard are <dfn>paste</dfn>d (inserted)
  into the session, using the current <dfn>edit point</dfn> as the
  destination. The contents of the clipboard remain unchanged &mdash; you
  can paste the same item multiple times. <br />
  The default key binding is <kbd class="mod1">v</kbd>.
