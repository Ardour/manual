<p>
  At the right of the editor is an optional area which provides one of a
  range of useful lists of parts of your session. It is not shown by default
  when you first start using Ardour. The <dfn>Editor list</dfn> can be hidden
  or shown using <kbd class="menu">View &gt; Show Editor List</kbd>. The very 
  right-hand side of the list gives a selection of tabs which are used to
  choose the list to view. The left-hand border of the list can be dragged to
  vary the width of the list.
