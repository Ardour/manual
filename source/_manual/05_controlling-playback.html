title: Controlling Playback
---                        
  
<p>
  Ardour offers many ways to <dfn>control playback</dfn> of your session, 
  including the transport bar, key bindings and remote controls. 
  You can also use markers to define locations or ranges within 
  the session and rapidly move around between them. 
</p>
<p class="note">
  If you synchronize Ardour with other devices then some or 
  all of these control methods may be unavailable &mdash; depending on 
  the synchronization protocol, Ardour may respond only to commands 
  sent from its master device(s).
