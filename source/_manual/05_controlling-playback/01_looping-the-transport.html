title: Looping the Transport
---                        
  
<p>
  When the <dfn>loop transport</dfn> button is pressed, the playhead will 
  jump the start of the loop range, and continue to the end of that range 
  before returning to the start and repeating.
  While looping, a light green area is displayed in the time ruler over 
  the tracks to show the loop range.
</p>
<p>
  By default, looping is bound to the <kbd>l</kbd> key.
</p>
