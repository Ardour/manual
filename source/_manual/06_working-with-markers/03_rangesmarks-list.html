title: Ranges &amp; Marks List
---                        
  
<p>
  The <dfn>Ranges &amp; Marks List</dfn> is a tab in the <dfn>Editor
  Lists</dfn> area on the right of the Editor window. If the editor 
  list area isn't visible it can be enabled by checking 
  <kbd class="option">View &gt; Show Editor List</kbd>. 
  The Ranges &amp; Marks list can be used as a single point 
  of control for all range and location markers (including the punch and 
  loop ranges), or as a supplement to other methods of working with them.
</p>


<h2>Common elements</h2>
<p>
  Each section has a set of <dfn>editable <a
  href="/ardours-interface/using-ardour-clock-displays/">clock widgets</a></dfn> 
  which display
  the location of a marker, or the start, end, and duration times of a range,
  respectively.<br />
  The <kbd class="menu">Use PH</kbd> buttons allow you to set 
  the corresponding clock to the current playhead position.
  A <kbd class="mouse">Middle</kbd> click on any of the clocks will move 
  the playhead to that location. Both functions are also available from the
  clock context menus.<br />
  Right clicking on any of the clocks brings up a context menu that allows 
  changing of the display between Timecode, Bars:Beats, Minutes:Seconds,
  and Samples.<br />
</p>
<p>
 The <kbd class="menu">&mdash;</kbd> (subtract) button in front of each
 user-defined range or marker in the list allows that particular item to
 be removed. The name fields of custom ranges and markers can be edited. 
</p>    
<p>
  The <kbd class="option">Hide</kbd> checkboxes make markers and ranges invisible 
  on the respective ruler to reduce visual clutter; the markers remain
  active however, and can be used normally.<br />
  Selecting <kbd class="option">Lock</kbd> prevents the respective marker 
  from being moved until unlocked.
  Where applicable, <kbd class="option">Glue</kbd> fixes the marker position
  relative to the current musical position expressed in bars and beats, rather 
  than the absolute time. This will make the respective marker follow
  changes in the tempo map.
</p>
<p>
  At the bottom of the list are buttons to add new markers or ranges.

 <h2>List sections</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Loop/Punch Ranges</dt>
  <dd>This list shows the current <dfn>loop</dfn> and <dfn>punch</dfn> range 
  settings. Since these are built-in ranges, you cannot rename or remove them.</dd>
  <dt>Markers (Including CD Index)</dt>
  <dd>This section lists the session's <dfn>markers</dfn>. By ticking <kbd
  class="option">CD</kbd>, you instruct Ardour to create a <dfn>CD track
  index</dfn> from this marker, which will be included in the TOC or CUE file when you
  export.</dd>
  <dt>Ranges (Including CD Track Ranges)</dt>
  <dd>This is the list of <dfn>ranges</dfn> (including <dfn>CD track
  ranges</dfn>). Ticking <kbd class="option">CD</kbd> will convert
  the range to a <dfn>CD track</dfn>, which will again be included in
  exported TOC or CUE files. This is relevant for Disk-At-Once recordings
  that may contain audio data between tracks.</dd>
