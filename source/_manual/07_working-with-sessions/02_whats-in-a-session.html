title: What's in a Session?
---                        
  
<p>
  The <dfn>Session</dfn> is the fundamental document type that is created and 
  modified by the Ardour workstation.  A Session is a folder on your computer 
  filesystem that contains all the items that pertain to a particular project 
  or "recording/editing/mixing session".
</p>
<p>
  The Session folder includes these files and folders:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code><em>session_name</em>.ardour</code> the main session snapshot</li>
  <li><code>*.ardour</code>, any additional snapshots </li>
  <li><code><em>session_name</em>.ardour.bak</code>, the auto-backup snapshot</li>
  <li><code><em>session_name</em>.history</code>, the undo history for the session </li>
  <li><code>instant.xml</code>, which records the last-used  zoom scale and other metadata</li>
  <li><code>interchange/</code>, a folder which holds your raw audio and MIDI 
  files (whether imported or recorded)</li>
  <li><code>export/</code>, a folder which contains any files created by the
  <kbd class="menu">Session &gt; Export</kbd> function</li>
  <li><code>peaks/</code>, a folder which contains waveform renderings of
  all audio files in the session</li>
  <li><code>analysis/</code>, a folder which contains transient and pitch 
  information of each audio file that has been analysed</li>
  <li><code>dead sounds/</code>, a folder which contains sound files which 
  Ardour has detected are no longer used in the session (during a <kbd
  class="menu">Session &gt; Clean-up &gt; Clean-up Unused Sources</kbd>
  operation, will be purged by <kbd class="menu">Flush Waste Basket</kbd>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A session combines some setup information (such as audio and MIDI routing, 
  musical tempo &amp; meter, timecode synchronization, etc.) with one or more 
  Tracks and Buses, and all the Regions and Plug-Ins they contain.
