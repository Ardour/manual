title: Where Are Sessions Stored?
---                        

<p>
  <dfn>Sessions</dfn> are stored in a single folder on your computer's filesystem. 
</p>
<p>
  The first time you run Ardour, you will be asked where you would like the
  default location for sessions to be, with the initial choice being your 
  home folder. 
</p>
<p>
  After the first-run dialog, you can still change the default location at 
  any time via <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Misc &gt; Session
  Management</kbd>. You can also specify a particular (different) location for 
  a session when creating it, in the 
  <a href="/working-with-sessions/new-session-dialog/">New Session dialog</a>.
</p>
