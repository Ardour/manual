title: Backup and Sharing of Sessions
---                        

<p>
  An Ardour session is stored in a single folder on your computer's filesystem. 
  This makes <dfn>backup</dfn> very easy &mdash; any tool capable of backing up 
  a folder can be used to backup a session. You pick the location of a session 
  when it is created &mdash; by default it will be in your default session location, 
  which can be altered via <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Misc &gt; Session
  Management</kbd>. 
</p>
<p class="warning">
  There is one complication: a session may reference media files that are stored 
  outside of the session folder, if the user has opted not to select <kbd
  class="optoff">Session &gt; Import &gt; Copy to Session</kbd> during
  import. Backing up a session with embedded files will not create a 
  copy of the session containing those files.
</p>
<p>
  The single folder approach also makes sharing a project easy. Simply copy the session 
  folder (onto a storage device, or across a network) and another Ardour user (on any 
  platform) will be able to use it. The limitation regarding embedded files applies to 
  session sharing as well.
