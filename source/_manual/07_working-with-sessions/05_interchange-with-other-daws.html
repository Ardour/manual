title: Interchange with other DAWs
---                        
  
<p>
  It has never been particularly easy to move sessions or projects from one
  <abbr title="Digital Audio Workstation">DAW</abbr> to another. There are two 
  <dfn>interchange standards</dfn> that have reasonably widespread support:</p>
<ul>
  <li>OMF (Open Media Framwwork), also known as OMFI. Developed and controlled 
  by Avid, never standardized</li>
  <li>AAF (Advanced Authoring Format). Developed by a consortium of media-related 
  corporations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In practice both of these standards have such complex and/or incomplete 
  specifications that different DAWs support them only partially,
  differently, or not at all.
