title: Copying The Interchange Folder
---                        
  
<p>
  All media in a session folder is stored in a sub-folder called 
  <samp>interchange</samp>. Below that is another folder with the name 
  of the session. You can copy either of these to another location and 
  use the files within them with any other application, importing them 
  all into a project/session. You will lose all information about regions, 
  tracks, and timeline positioning, but all the data that Ardour was working 
  with will be present in the other DAW. Nothing below the interchange 
  folder is specific to Ardour &mdash; any DAW or other audio/MIDI 
  application should be able to handle the files without any issues.
