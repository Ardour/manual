<h3>Using Playlists for Parallel Processing</h3>
<p>
  One of the uses of playlists is to apply multiple effects to the same 
  audio stream. For example, let's say you would like to apply two 
  different non-linear effects such as distortion or compression to the 
  same audio source (for linear effects, you could just apply them one after
  the other in the same track).<br />
  Create a new track, apply the original track's playlist, and 
  then apply effects to both tracks independently. 
</p>
<p class="note"> 
  The same result could be achieved by feeding your track to multiple busses which
  then contain the processing, but this increases the overall latency,
  complicates routing and uses more space in the Mixer window.

<h2>Using Playlists for "Takes"</h2>
<p>
  Using Playlists for <dfn>takes</dfn> is a good solution if you are going 
  to need the ability to edit individual takes, and select between them. 
</p>
<p>
  Each time you start a new take, create a new playlist with 
  <kbd class="menu">p &gt; New</kbd> 
  Later, you can Select your way back to previous or later takes as 
  desired.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to create a composite edit from multiple takes, create a new
  track to assemble the final version, and "cherry pick" from the playlists
  in the original track by copying regions over as required.<br />
  Alternatively, record each successive take on top of the 
  others in "layers" and then edit them using the layer tools, explained 
  later.
</p>
  
<h2>Using Playlists for Multi-Language Productions</h2>
<p>  
  The same approach as for takes is useful when you are recording or 
  editing content in multiple versions, such as dubbed movie dialog in
  several languages, and you want all versions on the same track, to 
  get the same processing. <br />
  Select the appropriate language before exporting the session.
