title: Adding Tracks and Busses
---                        

<img class="right" src="/ardour/manual/html/screenshots/add-track-or-bus.png" alt="the add-track dialog" />
<p>A track or bus can be added to a session in various ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose <kbd class="menu">Track &gt; Add Track or Bus</kbd>.</li>
  <li><kbd class="mouse">Right</kbd>-click in an empty part of the track controls area.</li>
  <li>Click the <kbd class="menu">Plus (+)</kbd> button underneath the list of tracks in the mixer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Any of these actions will open the Add Track or Bus dialog. Note that any 
  new tracks from this dialog will appear after the last currently selected 
  track, or at the end if no track is selected.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Add</dt>
  <dd>Here you can select the number of tracks or busses you wish to create, and
  their <a href="/working-with-tracks/track-types/">types</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Configuration</dt>
  <dd>This menu lets you choose from a number of <dfn><a href="/missing">route
  templates</a></dfn>, which determine the number of input ports and optionally
  contain plugins and other mixer strip configuration.</dd>
  <dt>Track mode</dt>
  <dd>This option is only available for audio tracks. See <a href="/working-with-tracks/track-types/#trackmodes">Track Modes</a> for details.</dd>
  <dt>Instrument</dt>
  <dd>This option is only available for MIDI tracks and lets you select a
  default instrument from the list of available plugins.</dd>
  <dt>Group</dt>
  <dd>Tracks and busses can be assigned groups so that a selected range of 
  operations are applied to all members of a group at the same time (selecting 
  record enable, or editing, for example). This option lets you assign to an 
  existing group, or create a new group.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
  New tracks appear in both the editor and mixer windows. The editor window 
  shows the timeline, with any recorded data, and the mixer shows just the 
  processing elements of the track (its plugins, fader and so on).
</p>

<h2>Removing Tracks and Busses</h2>
<p>
  To <dfn>remove</dfn> tracks and busses, select them, <kbd
  class="mouse">right</kbd>-click and choose <kbd
  class="menu">Remove</kbd> 
  from the menu. A warning dialog will pop up, as track removal cannot be undone; 
  use this option with care!
