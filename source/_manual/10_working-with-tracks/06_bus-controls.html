<img src="/ardour/manual/html/screenshots/typical-bus-controls.png" alt="bus controls" />

<p>
  At the top-left of the controls is the name of the bus, which can be
  edited by double-clicking on it. The new name must be unique within the 
  session. Underneath the name is a copy of the bus' main level fader. 
  The control buttons to the right-hand side are:

  a menu which dictates what particular parts of the bus should be muted.</dd>
