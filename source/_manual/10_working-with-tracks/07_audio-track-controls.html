<p> 
  An audio track has the same 
  <a href="/working-with-tracks/bus-controls">controls as a bus</a>, with the
  addition of two extras. 
</p>
<dl>
  <dt id="record" style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">[&bull;]</dt>
  <dd><dfn>Record</dfn> &mdash; The button with the pink circle arms the track 
  for recording. When armed, the entire button will turn pink, and change to 
  bright red as soon as the transport is rolling and the track is recording.</dd>
  <dt id="playlist">p</dt>
  <dd><dfn>Playlist</dfn> &mdash; Opens a playlist menu when clicked. The menu 
  offers various operations related to the track's <a
  href="/working-with-playlists/">playlist</a>.
  </dd>
