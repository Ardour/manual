title: Track and Bus Groups
---                        

<p>
  Tracks and busses can be put into <dfn>groups</dfn>. Members of a group 
  can share various settings &mdash; useful for managing tracks that are closely 
  related to each other. Examples might include tracks that contain 
  multiple-microphone recordings of a single source (an acoustic guitar, 
  perhaps, or a drum-kit).
</p>
<p>
  You can group tracks and busses in various ways. In the editor window, 
  a track's controls might look like these:
</p>
<img class="left" src="/ardour/manual/html/screenshots/track-in-group.png" alt="track headers for a group" />
<p> 
  The green tab to the left of the track header indicates that this track 
  is in a group called <samp>Fred</samp>. You can drag these tabs to add 
  adjacent tracks to a group.
</p>

<h2>Create New Groups</h2>
<p>
  There are several ways to <dfn>create groups</dfn> for tracks and bussess:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Context-click on the group tab and use one of the <kbd
  class="menu">Create...</kbd> options there. You can create a group with 
  no members, or one that starts with the currently selected tracks, or 
  record-enabled tracks, or soloed tracks.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, click the ‘g’ button on a track header to open the 
  Group menu. The menu lists the available groups. Selecting one of these 
  groups will add the track or bus to that group. The menu also lets you 
  create a new group.</li>
  <li>Finally, the Groups tab of the 
  <a href="/ardours-interface/introducing-the-editor-window/editor-lists">Editor Lists</a> 
  or the Mixer Window has a <kbd class="menu">plus (+)</kbd> button at the 
  bottom of the list. Click on the plus sign to create a new group.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Remove Groups</h2>
<p>
  Context-click on a <dfn>group tab</dfn> and select <kbd class="menu">Remove
  Group</kbd> from the menu. Removing a group does <em>not</em> remove 
  the members of a group.
</p>
<p>
  You can also remove groups by selecting them in the Groups tab of the 
  <a href="/ardours-interface/introducing-the-editor-window/editor-lists">Editor Lists</a> 
  or Mixer Window and then pressing the <kbd class="menu">minus (-)</kbd> 
  button at the bottom of the list.
</p>

<h2>Add/Remove Tracks and Busses From a Group</h2>
<p>
  Click the <kbd class="menu">g</kbd> button to display a menu with a list 
  of the available groups. Select one of these groups to add the track or bus 
  to that group. Select <kbd class="menu">No Group</kbd> to remove it.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, you can also drag a group tab to add or remove tracks from 
  the group.
</p>

<h2>Activate/Deactivate Groups via the Group Tab</h2>
<p>
  Clicking on a group tab toggles the group between being active and inactive. 
  An inactive group has no effect when editing its members. An active group 
  will share its configured properties across its members. Tabs for disabled 
  groups are coloured grey.</p>

<h2>Modify Group Properties</h2>
<p>
  To edit the properties of a group, context-click on its tab and choose 
  <kbd class="menu">Edit Group…</kbd>. This opens the track/bus group dialog, 
  which is also used when creating new groups:

<h3>Group Color</h3>
<p>
  Click on the color selector button to change a group's colour. This affects 
  the colour of the group's tab in the editor and mixer windows. The color does 
  <em>not</em> affect the color of the group members unless you also enable the 
  shared <kbd class="menu">Color</kbd> property. 
</p>

<h3>Shared Properties</h3>
<p>
  <kbd class="option">Gain</kbd> means that the track faders will be synced to 
  always have the same value; <kbd class="option">Relative</kbd> means that the 
  gain changes are applied relative to each member's current value. If, for 
  example, there are two tracks in a group with relative gain sharing, and their 
  faders are set to -3&nbsp;dB and -1&nbsp;dB, a change of the first track to a 
  gain of -6&nbsp;dB will result in the second track having a gain of
  -4&nbsp;dB (the <em>difference</em> of the gains remains the same).
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/working-with-tracks/bus-controls/#mute"><kbd class="option">Muting</kbd></a>, 
  <a href="/working-with-tracks/bus-controls/#solo"><kbd class="option">Soloing</kbd></a>, 
  <a href="/working-with-tracks/audio-track-controls/#record"><kbd class="option">record enable</kbd></a>, 
  <a href="/ardours-interface/introducing-the-editor-window/editor-lists/tracks--busses-list/#active"><kbd class="option">active state</kbd></a>, 
  <a href="/working-with-tracks/controlling-track-appearance/track-coloring/"><kbd class="option">colour</kbd></a> and 
  <a href="/recording/monitoring/"><kbd class="option">monitoring</kbd></a> 
  are all straightforward. They simply mean that all member tracks or busses will 
  share the same settings in these respects.
</p>
<p>
  <kbd class="option">Selection</kbd> means that if a region is selected or 
  deselected on one member track, <a
  href="/working-with-regions/corresponding-region-selection/">corresponding
  regions</a> on other member tracks 
  will be similarly selected. Since region editing operations are applied to all 
  currently selected regions, this is the way to make edits apply across all tracks 
  in the group.
</p>
