title: Windows VST Support
---                        

<p>
  Thanks to the combined work of Torben Hohn, Kjetil Mattheusen, Paul
  Davis and a few other developers, it is possible to use Windows 
  <dfn><abbr title="Virtual Studio Technology">VST</abbr>
  plugins</dfn> (that is, plugins in VST format built and distributed 
  for the Windows platforms) on Ardour running on Linux. (Note: there 
  is no VST support of any kind on OS X).
</p>

<p>However, doing so has three substantial downsides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It requires a special build of Ardour that is fundamentally 
  very different from normal builds.</li>
  <li>Support depends on <a href="http://winehq.org/">Wine</a>,
  a Windows "emulator".</li>
  <li>As usual with plugins, a crashing plugin will take Ardour down 
  with it. And crashes in Windows VST plugins are more likely when 
  used in this way.</li>
</ul>

<p>The dependence on Wine makes it almost impossible for the Ardour
project to support this feature. Wine's functionality generally
improves over time, but any given release of Wine may behave worse
with some or all Windows VST plugins. It may even just crash Ardour
completely.</p>

<p>Step back and think about what "using Windows VSTs" really means:
taking bits of software written with only one idea in mind - running
on the Windows platform - and then trying to use them on an entirely
different platform. It is a bit of a miracle (largely thanks to the
incredible work done by the Wine project) that it works at all. But is
this the basis of a stable, reliable DAW for a non-Windows platform?
Getting Ardour on Linux to pretend that its really a Windows
application running on Windows?</p>

<p>We understand that there are many outstanding plugins available as
Windows VSTs and that in many cases, no equivalent is available for
Ardour's Linux-based users. If your workflow is so dependent on those
plugins, then remain on Windows (or potentially consider using an
actual Windows VST host running inside of Wine). If you can make the
effort, you will get a better environment by using a normal build of
Ardour and exploring the world of plugins built to run on Linux
natively. This covers LADSPA, LV2 and Linux VST formats, and even some
outstanding proprietary plugins such as those
from <a href="http://www.linuxdsp.co.uk/">LinuxDSP</a>
and <a href="http://www.loomer.co.uk/">Loomer</a>.
</p>

<h2>A Plea To Plugin Manufacturers</h2>
<p>
  Please consider porting your plugins so that users can enjoy them on
  Linux too. Several other commercial plugin developers have already
  done this. You can choose between using "Linux VST" (which is what
  Loomer and others have done) - you will find toolkits like JUCE that
  help to make this fairly easy - or using LV2 format which is
  ultimately more flexible but probably more work. We have users -
  thousands of users - on Linux who would like to use your plugins.
