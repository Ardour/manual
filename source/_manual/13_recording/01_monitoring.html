<p>
  When recording, it is important that performers hear themselves, and to 
  hear any pre-recorded tracks they are performing with.
  Audio recorders typically let you <dfn>monitor</dfn> (i.e. listen to) 
  the input signal of all tracks that are armed for recording, and playing 
  back the unarmed tracks.
