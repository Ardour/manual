<p>
  Auxes and Subgroups share a common concept &mdash; they both provide a way 
  for one or more tracks (or busses) to send their signal to a single bus so 
  that common signal processing can be applied to the mix of their signals.

<p>
  <dfn>Aux sends</dfn> leave the existing signal routing to the main mix in place, 
  and are typically used to create a separate mix to send to (for example) 
  monitors or headphones (for performer monitor mixes):

  <dfn>Subgroups</dfn> usually remove the original signal routing to the main mix and
  replace it with a new one that delivers the output of the subgroup bus to 
  the main mix instead.
