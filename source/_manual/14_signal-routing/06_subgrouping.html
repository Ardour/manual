<p>
  <dfn>Subgrouping</dfn> (sometimes known as "Grouping" or "Audio Grouping")  
  is a way to collect related signals together to apply some common
  treatment, before sending them on to the main mix. One standard
  application is to group several tracks belonging to the same instrument or
  section (such as a drumkit or horn section), to be able to adjust their
  volume with a single fader, after their inner balance has been set using
  the track faders.

<p>
  To create a subgroup from an existing Track/Bus group, context-click on 
  the relevant <a href="/working-with-tracks/track-and-bus-groups">group tab</a>, 
  and choose <kbd class="menu">Add new subgroup bus</kbd>. A new bus will be 
  created and every member of the track group will have its outputs disconnected 
  from other destinations and then connected to the new bus inputs. The bus 
  outputs will feed the master bus unless you have selected manual connections 
  for the session. The bus will be named after the track group name.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, you can create a group manually, by first adding a new bus,
  then, for each track you want to feed the subgroup bus, disconnect its outputs
  from the master and connect it to the inputs of the subgroup bus instead.
  You can do this in the global audio patchbay or a track by track basis via the 
  output button of each track's channel strip.
</p>
<p>
  To remove a subgroup (bus), context-click on the track group tab, and select 
  <kbd class="menu">Remove subgroup bus</kbd>. You can also simply delete the 
  bus itself. Note that this operation will <strong>not</strong> restore signal 
  routing to the way it was before the addition of the subgroup bus &mdash; tracks 
  that had been subgrouped will be left with their main outputs disconncted.
