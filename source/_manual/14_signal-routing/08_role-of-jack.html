title: Role of JACK
---                        

<p>
  Ardour uses <dfn>JACK</dfn> for all its internal signal flow except
  between processors inside the same channel strip. This allows for a great
  deal of flexibility in routing signals, but comes with an increased
  latency penalty when using consecutive buses.
