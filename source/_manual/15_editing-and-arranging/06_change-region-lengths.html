title: Trimming Regions
---                        

<p>
  Changing the <dfn>length</dfn> of a region is a very common editing 
  operation, often known as <dfn>trimming</dfn>. There are several ways 
  to accomplish this with Ardour, and some very useful specialized trimming 
  operations.
</p>

<h2>Drag-Trimming With the Mouse</h2>
<p>
  In object mode, move the pointer near the beginning or end of the region. 
  The cursor will change to indicate that trimming is possible, and you then 
  <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd>-drag the edge of the region. 
</p>
<p>
  Trimming will obey <a href="/editing-and-arranging/snap-to-the-grid/">Snap settings</a>.
</p>

<h2>Click Trimming With the Mouse</h2>
<p>
  <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd>-click in the colored bar at the bottom of a region. 
  If you are nearer to the start of a region, this will trim the start time to the 
  position of the pointer. If you are nearer to the end of a region, it will trim the 
  end time.
</p>

<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts for Trimming</h2>
<p>
  There are several commands for region trimming. Some use the 
  <a href="/editing-and-arranging/the-edit-point">edit point</a> to determine where 
  to trim to. Some are not bound to any keys by default (but could be via the 
  Keybindings Editor).
</p>

<dl class="wide-table">
  <dt><kbd class="menu">Region/trim-front</kbd> <kbd>j</kbd></dt>
  <dd>Trim selected region(s) start to edit point.</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="menu">Region/trim-end</kbd> <kbd>k</kbd></dt>
  <dd>Trim selected region(s) end to edit point.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="trimtonextprevious">Trim to Next/Previous Region</h2>
<p>
  Sometimes you just want to extend the start or end of region so that it reaches 
  the end or start of an adjacent region. There is now an operation accessible 
  from the region context menu, under <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt;Trim &gt; Trim to
  Next</kbd> or <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Trim &gt; Trim to Previous</kbd>. This 
  will extend the selected regions so they directly adjoin their neighbours, unless 
  their source files are not long enough, in which case they will be extended to the 
  maximum possible. Trim to Next will extend the end of the selected regions to the 
  start of the next region; Trim to Previous will extend the start of the selected 
  regions to the end of the previous region.
</p>
<dl class="wide-table">
  <dt><kbd class="menu">Region/trim-to-previous-region</kbd> <kbd class="mod1">j</kbd></dt>
  <dd>Trim the start of selected region(s) to the end of the previous
  region.</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="menu">Region/trim-to-next-region</kbd> <kbd class="mod1">k</kbd></dt>
  <dd>Trim the end of selected region(s) to the start of the following
  region.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Other Possible Commands for Trimming</h2>
<p>
  These are not bound to any keys by default, but could be via the Keybindings 
  Editor. They can also be sent via OSC or other control protocols.
