title: Move Regions
---                        

<p>
  Ardour has a global <dfn>edit mode</dfn> selector at the left of the
  Editing toolbar, which affect how regions are moved or copied:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><kbd class="menu">Slide</kbd></dt>
  <dd>Regions move freely. Ardour creates overlaps when necessary.</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="menu">Lock</kbd></dt>
  <dd>No region motion is permitted (except for "nudge").</dd>
  <dt><kbd class="menu">Ripple</kbd></dt>
  <dd>The effect of an edit is reflected in the regions to the "right" of the edit</dd>
</dl>
<h2>More details about Ripple</h2>
<p>
  Ripple Edit mode provides the following conveniences:
  <ul>
    <li> Deleting a range will move later regions to compensate for the deleted time </li>
    <li> Deleting a region will move later regions to compensate for the deleted region's length </li>
    <li> Moving a region will move later regions to compensate for the length of the move</li>
    <li> Inserting a new region (via dragging or via Paste) will move later regions to the right to compensate</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p class="note">
  If <kbd class="menu">Snap To Grid</kbd> is enabled, then regions can 
  only move so that they align with locations determined by the current 
  snap settings (beats, or seconds, or other region boundaries, etc). 
  See <a href="/editing-and-arranging/snap-to-the-grid">Snap To the Grid</a> 
  for details.
