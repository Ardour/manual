<p>
  Ardour's handling of <dfn>MIDI editing</dfn> differs from most other DAWs 
  and MIDI sequencers.
</p>

<h2>Key features of Ardour MIDI handling</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    All editing is done in-place, in-window. There is no separate piano roll 
    window or pane. Edit notes right where you see them.
  </li>
  <li>
    All MIDI I/O is done via JACK for sample accurate timing and maximal 
    efficiency when communicating with external software synthesizers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every MIDI track has its own JACK MIDI port for input; it may have an 
    arbitrary combination of audio and MIDI outputs, depending on the signal 
    processing in the track; the full flexibility of JACK connectivity is 
    present for MIDI just as it is for audio.
  </li>
  <li>
    Full automation for MIDI tracks, integrated with the handling of all MIDI 
    CC data for each track.
  </li>
  <li>
    Controllers (CC data) can be set to discrete or continuous modes (the 
    latter will interpolate between control points and send additional
    data).
  </li>
  <li>
    There is a Normal and a  Percussive mode for note data editing.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <dfn>scroomer</dfn> is a combination scroll/zoom tool for altering 
    the zoom level and range of visible MIDI data.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Notable Differences</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fader (volume) control currently operates on transmitted MIDI data, not by sending CC
    #7.
  </li>
  <li>
    All note/data editing is per-region. There are no cross-region operations at this
    time.
  </li>
  <li>
    By default, copying a MIDI region creates a <dfn>deep link</dfn> 
    &mdash; both regions share the same data source, and edits to the contents of 
    one will affect the other. To break this link, select  
    <kbd class="menu">MIDI &gt; Unlink from other copies</kbd> from the region 
    context menu, after which the selected region(s) will have their own copies 
    of <em>only</em> the data that they visually display on screen. You will not 
    be able to trim the region back its original length after an Unlink operation, 
    and the operation cannot be undone.
  </li>
</ul>
