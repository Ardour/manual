<p>
  Although recording MIDI is a common way to create new MIDI regions, it is 
  often desirable to do so as part of editing/arranging.
</p>
<p>
  To create a new MIDI region, simply <kbd class="mouse">Left</kbd>-click in 
  a MIDI track. A region will be created that is one bar long. You can 
  <a href="/editing-and-arranging/changing-region-lengths">trim</a> it to any 
  length you want.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have created a region, you will probably want to 
  <a href="/editing-and-arranging/edit-midi/add-new-notes">Add some notes to it</a>.
</p>
