<h2>Selecting/Navigating note-by-note</h2>
<p>
  Tab selects the next note. <kbd class="mod1">Tab</kbd> selects the previous 
  note. <kbd class="mod3">Tab</kbd> or <kbd class="mod13">Tab</kbd> adds 
  the next/previous note to the selection.
</p>

<h2>Selecting notes with the mouse</h2>
<p>
  While in mouse object mode, you can click on a note to select it. Once you 
  have selected one note, <kbd class="mouse mod3">Left</kbd>-click on another 
  to select all notes between them. To add or remove a note to/from the 
  selection, click <kbd class="mouse mod1">Left</kbd>. You can also click and 
  drag outside of a note to <dfn>rubberband select</dfn> a series of notes.
</p>
<p>
  Three different selection operations are possible if you switch to mouse 
  range mode:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Vertical drags within the MIDI region will select all notes within the 
    spanned note range.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clicks on the piano header of the track (if visible &mdash; the track must 
    be tall enough to display it) will select all occurences of that note.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drags on the piano header of the track will select all notes within the 
    spanned note range.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Listening to Selected Notes</h2>
<p>
  If <kbd class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; MIDI &gt; Sound MIDI notes 
  as they are selected</kbd> is enabled, Ardour will send a pair of 
  NoteOn/NoteOff messages through the track, which will typically allow you to 
  hear each note as it is selected.
