title: MIDI Scene Automation
---                        

<p>
Ardour is capable of being used to both record and deliver MIDI
"scene" automation. These are MIDI messages typically used to switch
presets or "scenes" on a variety of external equipment (or
software), including lighting and other audio/video tools. A common
use case is to automatically change presets between songs or to change
lighting conditions based on a specific position on the timeline.
</p>
<p>
Each change from one scene to another is represented by a marker in
the "Marker" bar. 
</p>
<p>
Technically, scene changes are delivered as a combination of bank and
program change MIDI messages. MIDI allows for 16384 banks, each with
128 programs.
</p>

<h2>Recording Scene Changes</h2>

<p>
Ardour has a dedicated MIDI port named "Scene In". Connect this port
to whatever source(s) of MIDI scene (bank/program change) messages you
wish to record.
</p>
<p>
Whenever the global record enable button is engaged and Ardour's
transport is rolling, a new marker will be created for each scene
change message received via the "Scene In" port. 
</p>
<p>
If 2 different scene changes are received within a certain time
period, only the later one will be recorded as a new marker. The
default threshold for this is 1 millisecond.
</p>
<p>
If a scene change message is received while the playhead is close to
an existing marker with an associated scene change, the recording
process will alter the scene change in the existing marker rather than
adding a new one. The default threshold for this "proximity" test is 1
millisecond.
</p>

<h2>Manually Creating Scene Changes</h2>

<p>
This feature is not currently implemented.
</p>

<h2>Playing back Scene Changes</h2>

<p>
Ardour has a dedicated MIDI port named "Scene Out". Connect this port
to wherever you wish to send MIDI scene (bank/program change) messages.
</p>
<p>
When the global record enable button is
<em>not</em> enabled, the relevant message(s) will be sent via the
"Scene Out" port as the playhead rolls past each marker with a scene
change associated with it.
</p>

<h2>Editing Scene Changes</h2>
