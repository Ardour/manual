<p>
  Almost every available function in Ardour can be bound to a keyboard
  shortcut (and those few that cannot will usually respond to an <a
  href="//using-control-surfaces/controlling-ardour-with-osc/"><abbr
  title="Open Sound Control">OSC</abbr> command</a>). Ardour comes with a 
  rich set of default <dfn>key bindings</dfn> for the most commonly used
  functions.
</p>
<p>These bindings strive to be <dfn>mnemonic</dfn>, that is, easy and intuitive 
  to remember, and follow widely accepted conventions. As a general rule, 
  the first letter of an operation will be used for as a shortcut, if 
  available. This does not necessarily lead to the best ergonomics for 
  rapid editing &mdash; there are alternative binding sets for that &mdash; 
  but it does make it simpler for newcomers to remember some of the most 
  useful ones, for example<br />
  <kbd>S</kbd> for <kbd class="menu">Region &gt; Edit &gt; Split"</kbd>
  or<br />
   <kbd>P</kbd> for <kbd class="menu">Transport &gt; Playhead &gt; Playhead to Mouse</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
  Almost every key binding in Ardour can be changed in 
  <kbd class="menu">Window &gt; Key Bindings</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
  The conventions for using modifier keys (<kbd class="mod1">&nbsp;</kbd>, <kbd
  class="mod2">&nbsp;</kbd>, <kbd class="mod3">&nbsp;</kbd> etc.) differ among platforms, so we 
  provide different default bindings for each.
