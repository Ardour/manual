  This device has a Mackie/Logic Control Mode built in. In order 
  to put the controller into Mackie/Logic control mode turn on the 
  unit while holding third button from the left in the top most row
  of buttons (under the rotary encoder row). In this mode the LCD 
  display will show "LC". Your device is now ready to be used with Ardour.
