<h2>Devices using ipMIDI</h2>
<p>
  If you are using a device like the SSL Nucleus that uses ipMIDI, 
  no set up is required other than to ensure that your control surface 
  and computer are both connected to the same network.
</p>

<h2>Devices using conventional MIDI</h2>
<p>
  Before attempting to use a Mackie Control device that communicates via 
  a standard MIDI cable or a USB cable, you should ensure that 
  <a href="/setting-up-your-system/setting-up-midi/midi-on-linux">your Linux 
  MIDI environment is setup</a>.
