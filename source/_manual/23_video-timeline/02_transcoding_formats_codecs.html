title: Transcoding, Formats &amp; Codecs
---

<p>
  This chapter provides a short primer on video files, formats and 
  codecs â€“ because it is often cause for confusion:
</p>

<p>
  A video file is a <dfn>container</dfn>. It usually contains one 
  <dfn>video track</dfn> and one or more <dfn>audio tracks</dfn>. 
  How these tracks are stored in the file is defined by the 
  <dfn>file format</dfn>. Common formats are 
  avi, mov, ogg, mkv, mpeg, mpeg-ts, mp4, flv, or vob.
</p>
<p>
  Each of the tracks by itself is encoded using a <abbr
  title="Coder-Decoder"><dfn>Codec</dfn></abbr>. Common video codecs 
  are h264, mpeg2, mpeg4, theora, mjpeg, wmv3. Common audio codecs are
  mp2, mp3, dts, aac, wav/pcm.
</p>
<p>
  Not all codecs can be packed into a given format. For example the 
  mpeg format is limited to mpeg2, mpeg4 and mp3 codecs (not entirely true). 
  DVDs do have stringent limitations as well. The opposite would be .avi; 
  pretty much every audio/video codec combination can be contained in an avi 
  file-format.
</p>
<p>
  To make things worse, naming conventions for video codecs and formats are 
  often identical (especially MPEG ones) which leads to confusion.
  All in all it is a very wide and deep field. Suffice there are different 
  uses for different codecs and formats.
</p>

<h2>Ardour specific issues</h2>
<p>
  Ardour supports a wide variety of video file formats codecs. More 
  specifically, Ardour itself actually does not support any video at all 
  but delegates handling of video files to <a
  href="http://ffmpeg.org">ffmpeg</a>, which supports over 350 different 
  video codecs and more than 250 file formats.
</p>
<p>
  When importing a video into Ardour, it will be <dfn>transcoded</dfn> 
  (changed from one format and codec to another) to avi/mjpeg for internal 
  use (this allows reliable seeking to frames at low CPU cost &mdash; the 
  file size will increase, but hard disks are large and fast).
</p>
<p>
  The export dialog includes presets for common format and codec 
  combinations (such as DVD, web-video,..). If in doubt use one of the 
  presets.
</p>
<p>
  As last note: every time a video is transcoded, the quality can only get 
  worse. Hence for the final mastering/<abbr 
  title="Multiplexing Audio and Video">muxing</abbr> process, one should 
  always to back and use the original source of the video.
